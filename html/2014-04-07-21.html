Sorry for the late reply.

&gt; think you can pipeline the functions and receive their results
&gt; every clock cycle if you use the routing or buffering approach
&gt; (number #4 and number #3 on the list I had posted).  The real
&gt; question (for the attacker) is whether this is worth the overhead.
&gt; I think for complicated functions, it is.  And for simple functions
&gt; their die area is negligible, and portions of them like multipliers
&gt; may easily be shared between them, as Bill pointed out.
That is true in theory, though the overhead of interleaving many more
computations than parallel units might kill you (in hardware).

To #3: If you consider that you need to have a medium size memory -
let's say 64kB - per core (and as their content differs for each step,
you need to store them all in parallel), then you will most likely hit
the limit of parallel cores due to the memory consumption in hardware.
In this case, you will need to reduce the number of parallel cores
manually to keep more copies on the chip, working in an interleaved
mode of operation.
It might work, but I agree that the overhead is very likely to
outweight the benefits. Still it would be interesting to see someone
implement this buffering approach on an FPGA and compare it to a
straight-forward implementation.

To #4: see next paragraph :)
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, now that I think of it that way, the sharing of e.g. 
&gt; multipliers that Bill pointed out is not very different from "my" 
&gt; routing approach.  It's a similar concept applied at a different
&gt; level: in Bill's example it'd be "within a core" (and would apply
&gt; to portions of functions) and in my example it'd be "across cores"
&gt; (and would apply to whole functions).  Looking at this from yet
&gt; another angle it can be said that with the routing approach we're
&gt; re-defining "core" such that it tests lots of candidate passwords
&gt; at once using its pool of resources.
As this is the same idea that #4: you suggest to share the resources
between attacking cores or functions. You can do this of course, but
you will need to stall the computation in case you have a collision,
e.g., two or more cores/functions need the same hardware modules at
the same time.

So if you want to get a valid output every clock cycle *without any
stalls*, you need to use as much area as needed to perform any
operation in every pipeline stage.
Of course, you may reuse for example a multiply unit for two different
functions *within a pipeline stage*, as only one function needs to be
computed per step.
Nevertheless, you may not share modules over the boundary of the
pipeline stages without stalling the pipeline.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; This does not matter if you use friendly functions like XOR,
&gt;&gt; shift, etc., but we hope that using more complex but still CPU
&gt;&gt; friendly functions (this is why we tried floating-point), the
&gt;&gt; area consumption *may* hurt a little more.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe, but how would you avoid the kind of sharing that Bill
&gt; mentioned? Can you come up with a large number of sufficiently
&gt; different functions that not much sharing could occur?  To me, even
&gt; 16 feels too low, and I doubt you can come up with 16 without
&gt; allowing for shared multipliers, etc., yet being CPU-friendly.
You are correct: You cannot avoid it. But to be honest, it is not
really an issue, at least not for me. The idea is to add *something*
with each function, which increases the area a bit. In the worst case,
you just add to the complexity of the multiplexers and thus to the LUT
usage.
In the best case, you enforce the use of an additional
hardcore/additional logic circuit, e.g., a DSP core, which was
previously not needed.

[..]

&gt; Here's a CPU attack on AntCrypt (as I understand it): define all 
&gt; possible two-function groups.  For 16 original functions, this
&gt; will result in 256 dual-function functions, and if they're as tiny
&gt; as they currently are they will probably still fit in a CPU's L1i
&gt; cache.  Now you can define a dual-AntCrypt, testing two candidate
&gt; passwords at a time, and using the CPU core's parallel processing
&gt; capabilities (SIMD, multiple issue, super-scalar) it'll likely run
&gt; no slower than a single AntCrypt does.  So you get a 2x performance
&gt; boost for the attacker. Moreover, the cost of conditional branches
&gt; is amortized,
[.. removed due to followup email ]

I must admit, that I am not really the best when it comes to
platform-based, optimized CPU implementations. Would you benefit in
case the instructions inside of the dual-functions differ heavily? For
example, if one function computes an AND and the other an DIV or if
one is a simple MUL and the other a XOR? Or would you only benefit in
case you share the same instruction(s) at some point inside the functions?

And: how important do you rate the CPU attacker, if the GPU and FPGA
implementations are still likely to provide a much higher parallelism
due to the larger amount of parallel cores?
&gt; 
[..]
&gt; 
&gt; A way to mitigate these CPU attacks would be to define many more 
&gt; individual functions.  Another way would be to include sufficient 
&gt; parallelism in them (tunable to be barely enough for current and 
&gt; very-near-future CPUs), so that the defender is not at a
&gt; disadvantage. These two approaches may be used together.  (Not that
&gt; I like this whole approach, but like I said some diversity in PHC
&gt; is good anyway.)
We already mentioned a potential parallelism in the paper. The most
straight-forward method would be to process not one sequence alone but
n (independently permuted) sequences in parallel. The n sequences
should still diverge for GPUs (as they are not the same permutation),
but the speedup due to the parallel processing would be usable for
both the attacker and the defender.

The reason why we did not implement it directly is that we need to be
careful with synchronization when reading/writing from/to the memory.
As "#parallel_resources" is no part of the interface, we need to
ensure that the result is the same for every batch size.

Anyway: Would adding such parallelism help address/soften the
relevance of the CPU attack? It will at least give the defender more
control over the utilized resources.


A last question: Are we allowed to update the code and document for
such a change? Then I would add the parallelism to the code as soon as
I find the time to implement and test it.

Cheers,
Ralf
