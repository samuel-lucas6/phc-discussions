Subject: Re: [PHC] Asymmetry [Was: Any "large verifiers" on the panel?]

&gt;From a practical perspective, I'm highly skeptical that most users would
actually store such a secret differently/out of reach of an attacker. If
you've compromised the server, you almost certainly have access to any
secrets. Online attacks are problematic, but offline attacks are far worse.
If a scheme can't offer a decent amount of protection for the digests of
low-entropy passwords when they (and any secrets) are compromised, then it
is not very good, IMHO. That's not to say that having the ability to
leverage a HSM (if available) to make it even harder wouldn't be great
feature, of course. I just think that will be rare.

One notable exception to this that I can think of is if you e.g. have some
(possibly global) secret which is loaded from e.g. disk instead of the
database--then attackers who are only able to leverage a SQL injection
vulnerability would not be able to do much with the salt+digests from the
database.

&gt; &gt;&gt; shouldn't we expect that the same compromises that would get the
&gt; &gt;&gt; password hashes would also getat that secret?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Correct. You have to assume that if the passwords are compromised, the
&gt; &gt; encryption key is as well.
&gt;
&gt; From other responses (cf Marsh Ray) it seems that this really is the
&gt; assumption that is in (some) dispute. So here's my thinking on this
&gt; now (as opposed to a few hours ago when I posted my response to
&gt; Peter Gutmann).
&gt;
&gt; We all know that we are talking about situations in which a server
&gt; gets compromised. And in principle, once a system is compromised
&gt; it's hard to trust anything about it. But it also seems that a case
&gt; can be made for saying that a small secret, which is only every
&gt; used for verification, can be protected better than a very large
&gt; database that may legitimate uses beyond authentication.
&gt;
&gt; Some notation to make the following easier to talk about (at least
&gt; for me).  S is the server. k_S is this secret that S has access to
&gt; allowing S to verify passwords quickly instead of slowly. D_S is
&gt; the password-hash database.  Let R_k and R_D be the risks of exposure
&gt; of k_S and D_S. I'm not sure what units R should be measured in,
&gt; but we can leave that aside.
&gt;
&gt; There are arguments that in practice R_k is substantially smaller
&gt; than R_D.  k_S is a small secret D_S is a big secret, so k_S can
&gt; be kept on an HSM.  D_S will be backed-up in less secure places
&gt; than k_S; There will be people and systems in the organization that
&gt; need access to D_S who will not need access to k_S.
&gt;
&gt; We already assume that a compromise of S is not complete. After all
&gt; if S is completely compromised during a period of time, then client
&gt; credentials could simply be sniffed prior to verification.
&gt;
&gt; Furthermore, there is uncertainty about R_D and R_k, and those risks
&gt; will change over time. Even if we argue today that R_k is isn't
&gt; substantially smaller than R_D, we don't know that that will remain
&gt; true tomorrow. New techniques (and attacks) for managing k_S will
&gt; emerge.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, it is hard to get nice security proofs under
&gt; conditions of a compromised server.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
