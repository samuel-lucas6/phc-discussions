Hi Alexander,

I do not quite agree with you here.

&gt; (I think per Colin's definition of sequential memory-hard function it
&gt; is OK if "reducing the memory does not increase the cost", as long as
&gt; the product of space and time does not decrease by more than a constant
&gt; factor.  You appear to be using a stricter definition/requirement here.
&gt; We might need a different name for tradeoff-resistant functions like
&gt; that, or always mention that property separately.)
&gt;


The definition you mention is about asymptotics. Of course, in practice a
constant factor does make sense, for instance if it is 1000 or so.
Even if it is not that big, any cost reduction is beneficial for the
adversary. Furthermore, the product of time and space is quite rough a
metric. It is relevant
when your chip consists of homogeneous cores, and the cost is proportional
to the total number of calls to such cores. Whereas this model seems
correct for exhaustive key search or Bitcoin mining, its applicability to
functions that use Gbytes of RAM is doubtful, to say the least.

Coupling this with the concept that the a good hashing scheme should
motivate the adversary to crack it on the same hardware and the same
parameters where it is running, we get that a memory-hard function should
prohibit as much as possible any cost reduction for the adversary, by
constant factor or not.



&gt;
&gt; I think PHC is quite different from usual cryptographic competitions in
&gt; that providing excessive (which probably means any at all) safety
&gt; margins e.g. against tradeoff attacks actually makes PHC candidates less
&gt; secure, not merely less attractive in other (non-security) ways (as it
&gt; would be the case with ciphers and regular crypto hashes).  To ensure
&gt; e.g. yescrypt isn't broken in the sense you mention, I'd need to provide
&gt; some safety margin in my recommended value for t, or to define yescrypt
&gt; such that t=0 would correspond to a higher running time (e.g., to what
&gt; is now requested with t=1 or higher).  However, I think doing so would
&gt; be counter-productive for actual goals of PHC, because there's a
&gt; security tradeoff here, not just a security vs. something else tradeoff.
&gt; The value of t that is optimal for security should be barely adequate to
&gt; withstand tradeoff attacks, with no safety margin.


I am not sure that I understand correctly your notion of "security" in
general, which for some reason may contradict the tradeoff resilience.
The only such measurement of security that comes to my mind is the cost
difference between running the hash scheme on server hardware and on
adversary's hardware without any tradeoffs. If you double the number of
iterations and halve the memory (to keep the same running time), this gap
may indeed increase (maybe by 10% or so, if we talk about Gbytes of RAM).
However, if your scheme is not tradeoff-resilient, an adversary will
certainly use the most beneficial tradeoff. If he can reduce his costs
threefold because of tradeoffs, then doubling the number of iterations
actually makes his life worse, both in relative and absolute terms.


&gt;   As a result, I'm
&gt; afraid we should go the other way around: from smaller t to higher if we
&gt; have to as shown by attacks, and we should not be too surprised to find
&gt; such attacks, nor should we throw babies out with the water merely
&gt; because the initial proposed settings didn't have a safety margin and
&gt; proved somewhat too weak against some attacks.  They shouldn't have had
&gt; that safety margin, or the scheme would have been suboptimal
&gt; security-wise in another way!


As shown by crypto competitions, it is quite easy to tweak your design
against every new attack. If all such designs remain in competition, then
instead of evolution-like selection of the best and simplest design, we get
a zoo of over-complicated entries. Cryptanalysts not only have their eyes
blurred because of looking at the same candidates, but also their attention
is spread over many more targets than needed.

Also, given our limited insight into the hardware and cryptanalysis
development over the next years, having no security margin does not make
sense to me at all.
