&gt; It looks like all memory accesses are predictable, therefore a custom external memory subsystem could be constructed which accepts streaming data as fast as you can you can move it on and off the chip (IO pin count * clock rate * DDR perhaps). But presumably the defender would not be able to utilize such an architecture, so it would represent an advantage to the attacker.

Yes, the predictable memory addressing presents a problem.  For the
actual current code, feel free to check out:

<a href="https://github.com/waywardgeek/noelkdf" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waywardgeek/noelkdf</a>

It may or may not compile at any moment, since I'm actively working on
it and check in code regularly.  Here's my current documentation on
the algorithm, which does not deal with multi-threading, but otherwise
I think it's accurate.

Given an a user's password x, salt, an optional session key, a
cryptographic hash function H wrapped with PBKDF2, an array of m
memory locations v, and a cheat-killer speedup factor K, the algorithm
for NoelKDF is:

Input: x, salt, sessionKey, H, m, blockLen, K
Output: y

y = H(x, salt, sessionKey)
v[0 .. blockLen-1] = H(y)
prevV = 0
for i = 1 .. m/blockLen - 1
    addr = blockLen*(i + (Rand(i) % i))/2
    for j = 0 .. blockLen-1
        v[i] = MultHash(v[i-1], v[addr], prevV)
        prevV = v[addr]
for(i = 0; i &lt; m/K; i++)
    addr = Rand(prevV) % m
    y ^= v[addr]
    prevV = v[addr]
output y


function MultHash(v1, v2, prevV2):
    return v1*(v2 | 1) + prevV2

function Rand(v):
    return v*1103515245 + 12345

The second loop I believe forces an attacker who tries to compute the
key without keeping all the memory to recompute most of the missing
values, and if he has much less than 1/4th of the memory, I think he
pays O(m^2/K) recomputation penalty.  I still have to prove that,
though.

The first loop is difficult for an attacker to compute faster because
of the multiply operation.  It takes most of the runtime.  The second
loop leaks cache timing information, and could be used to abort an
incorrect password, but that wont significantly help an attacker
because he's already spent most of the time required to complete the
password guess.

You are correct that a sophisticated attacker could prefetch memory
better than my CPU because of the fixed addressing in the first loop.
However, with a block size of 4K bytes, I'm not seeing any significant
memory latency issues.  Hashing 2GB in .4 seconds will still require
an attacker move 4GB (one read, one write), over more than half of
that .4 seconds.  I am only able to get to about 10GB/second with two
threads, though, and I would prefer to do better.  An SSE version
could be written that might increase to more like 20GB/second, but I'm
frankly not sure that will work.  The idea would be that instead of 4
threads working on 4 separate fragments of memory, I'd interleave the
memory and execute 4 instructions in parallel on 4 words in parallel.
If that works, it should get close to maxing out my memory bandwidth
while still providing the multiplication computation time-hardness.

Thanks again for the feedback.  I feel like this multiplication thing
is the right way to go, but I'm not 100% sure.

Bill
