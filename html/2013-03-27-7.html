&gt; I think separating the Generate and Verify into formally distinct algorithms is a nice idea, and it's consistent with the way (some) people define MACs. It also allows for types of randomized hashing that wouldn't be possible using a single algorithm.

Is such randomization, beyond what's provided by the supplied salt,
desirable?  Even if it (potentially) is, how about we make the
Generate/Verify interface optional/allowed rather than required?

I can also imagine a Verify algorithm that works differently from
Generate - e.g., a DES-based crypt(3) hash could be verified by
decrypting it with the password being tested, and then the DES block
would eventually be tested for being 0.  I see no reason to do things in
this way, but perhaps for some other password hashing scheme it could
make sense.  Again, it's a reason to allow for the Generate/Verify
interface, but not a reason to require it.

Other than possibly for the reasons given above, I think Verify is
beyond scope of PHC (and a distraction from actual goals of PHC).
I think we don't want 90% of PHC submissions to include their own copies
of constant-time comparison code.  It is not really specific to PHC
submissions.  Besides, with proper salting and with salts being stored
along with the hashes as they should be (so they're unlikely to leak
separately from the hashes), constant-time comparison is redundant.

PHC submissions are primarily/initially to be discussed and reviewed,
they're not for immediate use.  The PHS() function prototype was defined
for consistency of the submissions, to assist with our evaluation.
Would PHC benefit from having a PHS_VERIFY() function with every
submission, even in cases where it's simply a memcmp() equivalent (or a
constant-time one)?  Hardly.  Should we be reviewing those comparison
functions at all?  I think not, and I think it'd be wrong to reject a
potentially great password hashing scheme because its author e.g. chose
not to implement constant-time comparison in PHS_VERIFY().  This is
usually not part of the password hashing scheme; the comparison code may
usually be replaced for an existing password hashing scheme without
breaking compatibility.

Once a PHC submission becomes a finalist or a winner, would its users
benefit from the PHS() and PHS_VERIFY() functions?  Hardly.  I think the
submissions will also have their own APIs that better reflect their
available parameters, and some of these APIs will be recommended for use.

Another aspect is that a password hashing scheme that is only usable in
form of Generate/Verify, but not Generate alone (to be used for
verification too), is not suitable for inclusion in crypt(3).  We should
consider that as its drawback.

That said, I agree that when it comes to actual use, a good
implementation should provide the Generate and Verify functions.
(I did just that in phpass, and it may have helped adoption.)
It's just not PHC material, at least not until we're talking about
publishing at least the finalists in a form intended for users.
