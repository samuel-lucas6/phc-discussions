Subject: Re: [PHC] PHC status report

Succinct response (not much time to elaborate):

* You will find "secretive selection" and non-public discussions of
the committee panel in all crypto competitions: AES, NESSIE, eSTREAM,
SHA-3, CAESAR, and PHC.

* A non-negligible difference of PHC compared to other projects: we're
all unpaid volunteers, working on this project on our free time, where
NIST had a dedicated team for AES and SHA-3, a budget to organize
workshops, etc.

* We wished we had time and resources to prepare a lengthy and
detailed report, but that wasn't the case. We felt that it was better
to publish such a summary than nothing at all.

&gt; Dear all,
&gt;
&gt; I think the discussion is not leading to a meaningful and factual direction.
&gt; Let me humbly try to steer the discussion towards concrete measures and stop
&gt; this blame game. There are some TO-DO items in the comments, which can help
&gt; restore the credibility of the competition (at least among some of us who
&gt; are not happy about it).
&gt;
&gt; 1. The panel should make the voting and discussion on the selection criteria
&gt; public.
&gt;
&gt; I refer to the AES competition archived selection criteria here:
&gt; <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm" rel="nofollow">http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm</a> Note the language
&gt; from section 4: "In order to provide a basis for the analysis and evaluation
&gt; of encryption algorithms submitted to be considered for incorporation into
&gt; the FIPS for AES, evaluation criteria will be used to review candidate
&gt; algorithms.  All of NIST’s analysis results will be made publicly
&gt; available."
&gt;
&gt; It is in the spirit of an open competition to keep the process transparent.
&gt; All discussion leading to the selection should have been public already.
&gt;
&gt; 2. I had pointed this earlier that the comment on our design Rig is as
&gt; follows: "Similar to Catena, but received less attention (cf. bugs found in
&gt; the specification and code)".
&gt;
&gt; There are two parts to this comment. (a) Similar to Catena. (b) bugs found.
&gt;
&gt; I would have liked the panel to clarify each of the two points with respect
&gt; to the revised submission Rig v2 which is the one the PHC website lists
&gt; since October 2014. Clearly, (b) is false for this. Further, is (a)
&gt; measurable by any means ?  Aren't there novel ideas in the design of Rig,
&gt; apart from ideas from Catena ? Given the publicly available eprint report
&gt; which I referred to in my previous mail, is it fair to dismiss the design in
&gt; this single sentence ? If Rig v2 was not being considered, shouldn't the
&gt; designers have been informed at the time of the revised submission itself
&gt; that this version will not be evaluated any more ? (Related: weren't other
&gt; design also allowed to be modified around the same time ? The changes were
&gt; not overhauling the design, these were minor modification to handle the
&gt; issues which Bill Cox found. I don't think there was any comment on the
&gt; design after that. If the panel was not looking at the revised submission
&gt; then we could have as well saved our time to do other things, rather than
&gt; investing our time in something which no one was interested in looking at.)
&gt;
&gt; 3. It is not just our design. Most designs have one line comments on them in
&gt; the document shared earlier. To say that the panel could not prepare a
&gt; detailed document is mocking the competition. As pointed by Krisztian
&gt; earlier, many of these one liners are actually not factual but based on
&gt; opinions. The report should have had meaningful comparison of the
&gt; candidates, not just one liners on the entries. Dismissing entries by such
&gt; one liners is devaluing the effort put by so many designers in the
&gt; competition.
&gt;
&gt; If you want some specific metrics, then here is a randomly thought list
&gt; which is not exhaustive: performance on various platforms, cryptographic
&gt; strength, memory hardness, .... (add whatever else you like, make a baseline
&gt; and compare all entries on some rational basis).
&gt;
&gt; In my humble opinion, the bitterness which we are witnessing in the mailing
&gt; list is due to the secretive selection and the improper rationale for
&gt; selection in the document. If these were public and based on detailed
&gt; discussions, I don't think anyone would have complained. IMHO, the panel
&gt; members should have already realized that there is a lot to blame themselves
&gt; rather than the people questioning their decision now. To blame the
&gt; questions on the "frustration of non-finalists" is not showing the maturity
&gt; expected from a panel, which contains many good people whom many of us
&gt; trusted (if that was not the case then you wouldn't have received so many
&gt; submissions in the first place). Honestly, please discuss with some
&gt; researchers in universities around you about the way the selection has
&gt; happened so far, showing them the "selection rationale document" and "the
&gt; process followed" (the secret voting, and not even following that voting
&gt; perfectly;  claiming that this was in addition to the private discussion
&gt; etc). I am quite certain that none of them will favor the process as
&gt; followed. All of it was easily avoided by keeping the process in public
&gt; domain and having a well thought out selection document.
&gt;
&gt; To quote Bruce Schneier on the AES competition (a losing finalist for the
&gt; competition): "I have nothing but good things to say about NIST and the AES
&gt; process".
&gt;
&gt; We were expecting a competition in the spirit of AES, but unfortunately
&gt; things haven't gone that way.
&gt;
&gt; 4. I deviate slightly to the "flexibility" and "simplicity" ideas of the AES
&gt; competition. The AES competition had a criteria termed "simplicity", but it
&gt; already created lots of discussion/confusion that time. To quote a few lines
&gt; from the TwoFish team (<a href="https://www.schneier.com/paper-twofish-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.schneier.com/paper-twofish-final.pdf</a>) "
&gt; "Simplicity” is the NIST criterion that’s hardest to describe. Lines of
&gt; pseudocode, number of mathematical equations, density of lines in a block
&gt; diagram: these are all potential measures of simplicity. Our worry about
&gt; simplicity as a measure is that the simplest algorithms are often the
&gt; easiest to break. ...".
&gt;
&gt;  If things are hazy then people will question them.
&gt;
&gt; Regards.
