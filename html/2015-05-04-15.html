&gt; &gt;I just recalled an earlier discussion in here where Christian Forler
&gt; &gt;felt it was OK for Catena to absolutely rely on salt uniqueness for a
&gt; &gt;feature, and I felt otherwise:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/612/focus=659" rel="nofollow">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/612/focus=659</a>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;While uniqueness isn't randomness, the similarity is in strong reliance
&gt; &gt;on a property of the salts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think this shows my pragmatism.  When this kind of reliance isn't
&gt; &gt;absolutely required for a security feature (there was another way to
&gt; &gt;specify the feature in question), I am against it.  When there's a
&gt; &gt;tradeoff between a not-yet-practically-relevant weakness and a currently
&gt; &gt;practically relevant one, I may well choose to accept the former and
&gt; &gt;mitigate the latter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Arguably, this also shows Catena team's inconsistency. ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; I see the smiley, but I don't get the joke.

The smiley means that I am not being entirely serious about that
statement.  I realize that it's a stretch.  Especially now that I found
you actually have uuid as a separate input from salt.

&gt; This is wrong for two reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, there is a simple logical implication, which holds for all salts 
&gt; of decent sizes (like 128 bit for PHC):
&gt; 
&gt;     If the salt is random
&gt;     then it is unique (except with negligible probability).
&gt; 
&gt; Thus, by relaxing the requirement (from random to unique) we get a 
&gt; stronger scheme. And by inverting the requirement (from unique to random) 
&gt; you get a weaker scheme.

As I wrote, "the similarity is in strong reliance on a property of the
salts".  I didn't mean to imply it's a similarly strong property.  You
are correct that it isn't.

&gt; You try to generate a counterexample to the logical implication

No.

&gt; by discussing 12-bit salts from old unix crypt. But this is 2015 and PHC, 
&gt; unix crypt is history.

I referred to the historical example because you (quite reasonably)
insist on salts only being expected to possess whatever properties they
possessed historically.

I am opposing you in this thread for the sake of achieving a balanced
discussion of the topic, by putting our arguments to test.

&gt; Secondly, Christian has actually been pointing out the development for 
&gt; encryption and authenticated encryption. Initially, many (mostly 
&gt; un-authenticated) encryption schemes assumed a random "initial value". 
&gt; Later, authors of encryption schemes just assumed unique nonces. By 
&gt; weakening the schemes, they got stronger cryptography. Currently, the 
&gt; discussion among cryptographers is about robust schemes: Even if you 
&gt; assume a unique nonce for authenticated encryption, does it make sense to 
&gt; maximise the remaining security you can preserve if nonces are 
&gt; accidentally reused?

I don't see what you're arguing with here.  My point in that old
discussion I referred to was precisely that Catena's hash encryption
feature could be made more robust by not relying on unique IDs (and
instead using a block cipher).  Catena team opted for simplicity vs.
(theoretical) robustness.  This may be reasonable, since simplicity (not
needing an extra crypto primitive, nor building an own one out of a
hash) may result in more robust implementations.

The "inconsistency" I mentioned is that Catena team does not always opt
for greater (theoretical) robustness.

&gt; Of course, the Catena team consists of different human beings which may 
&gt; have different opinions on some issues, or even change their opinion over 
&gt; time. Maybe, that is what the smiley was about?

I did have this thought too, but the smiley is primarily about the
statement not being entirely serious.
