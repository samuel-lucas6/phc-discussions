&gt; I reran EARWORM with some tweaks.  I set the "width" to 512, and the

&gt; calls to prf, since they were slowing down the algorithm considerably.  The
&gt; modified code does:
&gt; 
&gt; 14.48 GiB/s
&gt; 
&gt; Wow!  That's the new record.

That's really cool, but let's not forget that EARWORM is useful (only?)
on authentication servers, which means that we mostly care about
throughput during request rate spikes - so for many threads, not for one
thread.  It's not a KDF you would use e.g. in TrueCrypt.

&gt; This tweaked version has better ROM bandwidth
&gt; hardening, because an attacker splitting the ROM into N pieces will have to
&gt; transmit 4KiB of scratchpad data between nodes every time it updates a
&gt; scratchpad state, and the new node will only be able to hash 4KiB of data
&gt; into the scratchpad state before it has to be transmitted again.  However,
&gt; it has worse runtime hardening, because all 256 AESINC hashes can be
&gt; computed in parallel.  This is likely also why the bandwidth increased.
&gt; 
&gt; I put back the constants the way they were originally, made the scratchpad
&gt; array EARWORM_CHUNK_AREA+4 in size, and then I chained the AESINC
&gt; computations in 4 lanes, with a simple hack, and now I get:
&gt; 
&gt; 12.44 GiB/s
&gt; 
&gt; This version has both large enough state size and compute time hardening.

Cool.

Why did you choose 4 lanes?  Current CPUs need 5 to 9 cycles to compute
AESENC, so 4 lanes are probably (barely) enough when running 2
threads/core, but not enough on Intel CPUs lacking HT (OK, these are not
meant to be used in servers, and older ones of these lack AES-NI) and
with HT disabled (OK, maybe it's those admins' problem).

In EARWORM, I think there's almost no harm from including excessive
parallelism (unlike e.g. in yescrypt, where excessive parallelism hurts
some of the non-ROM defenses), so maybe make it 8 or 16 lanes?

Not including enough parallelism gives attackers extra advantage.

Oh, low throughput on Avoton.  That's nasty.  So if we include more
parallelism, we incur 5x slowdown on Avoton compared e.g. to Haswell.
And if we don't include more parallelism, we leave that speedup on
Haswell, etc. (as well as on GPUs) for the attacker only.  We just have
to use that speedup ourselves, and accept that Avoton will be slow at
EARWORM.

&gt; I think this is on the right track.  In particular, EARWORM in its current
&gt; form can be attacked both in terms of cost per guessing node (reducing the
&gt; ROM per node by a factor of N) and how many guesses can be computed in
&gt; parallel on each node, attacking both the time and cost dimensions of
&gt; EARWORM's defense.  With only 512 state bits per ongoing password hash, and
&gt; a 1TiB ROM split 256 ways, it is reasonable for each node to have 100
&gt; million or more password guesses stored in local RAM, giving us an
&gt; opportunity for 100 EARWORM hashing cores to work in parallel per node.
&gt;  This modification above seems to harden EARWORM's time dimension against
&gt; attacks that split the ROM N ways.  With this change, each node will only
&gt; be able to do about one EARWORM hash at a time.

I haven't looked at EARWORM recently, so can't review your changes, but
what you write above sounds reasonable.
