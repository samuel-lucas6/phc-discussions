&gt;&gt; Bill, this sounds cool, but let's not forget that maximizing single
&gt;&gt; thread's memory bandwidth usage is a goal only in a subset of use cases
&gt;&gt; (in 1 out of 3 categories, as I tried to explain earlier), whereas in
&gt;&gt; others it's actually a drawback (it means that other resources are not
&gt;&gt; fully made use of for defense when the defender is running more than one
&gt;&gt; thread).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Agreed.  This level of analysis is one reason I'm sticking to yescript as
&gt; my favorite Script-inspired entry.  However, speed is fun!  Also, most
&gt; entries run into problems like cache miss penalties dominating runtime at
&gt; large memory sizes, where an attacker could find ways around that.  I would
&gt; say that on the whole, the PHC entries are erring on the side of being too
&gt; slow and not using enough memory, like you say, there is a point beyond
&gt; which speed becomes a negative.
&gt;
&gt; With decent compute-time hardening, using multiple CPUs adds some defense,
&gt; especially if you are able to tie up multiple caches, which of all the
&gt; entries, only Yescript seems and TwoCats seem able to do well (thanks to
&gt; your inputs on TwoCats).  I misused the t_cost parameter to tune cache
&gt; bandwidth vs external memory.  I'm hoping to correct that in the tweak
&gt; phase where if it's allowed, I'll make t_cost control outer loop
&gt; iterations, and change my current timeCost to something like
&gt; bandwidthControl.
&gt;
&gt; We are still analyzing our "p" parameter to see if we get a good result
&gt; with multiple cores (it is one one of the tweaks we did not have enough
&gt; time to tune in the original submission, but that is described in the
&gt; documentation). This definitely does not mean we will be able to beat
&gt; TwoCats ou Yescrypt in that regard, especially considering that you
&gt; understand better hardware details than I believe we do, but it will be fun
&gt; trying :-)
&gt;

Sweet.  Alexander understands both CPUs and GPUs far better than me.  A lot
of the fun is in trying to keep up with him.  TwoCats wouldn't even be
competitive if it weren't for Alexander's various suggestions.


&gt;
&gt; When comparing against scrypt or yescrypt in terms of single thread's
&gt;&gt; memory bandwidth usage, I think we need to compare against reduced
&gt;&gt; rounds versions of scrypt and yescrypt.  This means scrypt with 2 rounds
&gt;&gt; of Salsa20 (just delete 3 out of 4 uses of SALSA20_2ROUNDS from
&gt;&gt; SALSA20_8_BASE in yescrypt-simd.c) and yescrypt native mode with 1 round
&gt;&gt; of pwxform (just delete 5 out of 6 uses of PWXFORM_ROUND in PWXFORM).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A hashing scheme pretending to win solely(?) in these terms would need
&gt;&gt; to show that it outperforms these trivial modifications of [ye]scrypt.
&gt;&gt; And there's not a lot of room to outperform them, even when we do, as
&gt;&gt; we're getting quite close to the available bandwidth.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I agree.  However, I'm enjoying this metric as my "alternate win
&gt; condition".  It's how I entertain myself.  I'm bummed that EARWORM and
&gt; Lyra2 beat my memory bandwidth with one thread, but at least I'm writing to
&gt; more memory per thread than the rest :-)
&gt;
&gt; Well, it is just as trivial to change our "rho" parameter, which controls
&gt; the number of rounds of Blake2b, which is currently hardcoded... We are,
&gt; however, more inclined to verify the usefulness of the "chi" parameter to
&gt; slow things down, since it controls small random reads on the rows used in
&gt; each loop (and, hopefully, that remained on cache). With this, we could
&gt; reduce the memory bandwidth usage, using more of the machine's processing
&gt; budget to provide better GPU resistance.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, I think I prefer the win condition "best TMTO resistance", which
&gt; was one of the things we put more effort at, so, even if we lose, hopefully
&gt; it won't be by too much :-)
&gt;

With t_cost &gt; 1, you'll certainly beat TwoCat's TMTO resistance, and with
the XORing over memory, doing 2 writes for every 1 write TwoCats does, you
likely have much better TMTO resistance with t_cost == 1.

Alexander's time cost parameter is used in a way that seems to increase
memory writes in a manner similar to Lyra2, if I'm not mistaken.  If I
understand things right, there's some ratio of Lyra2 t_cost to Yescript
t_cost where both have roughly equal TMTO resistance.  I opted instead to
have a more complex memory access pattern and to get whatever TMTO
resistance I can in 1 pass.  With the dual-writes in each hashing step, you
already have double the write bandwidth, and if you do multiple overwrite
passes (t_cost &gt; 1, right?) your TMTO resistance goes through the roof.  I
think TwoCat's has what I'll call "good" TMTO resistance, where an attacker
gains very little in terms of time*memory cost (using half the memory
requires around twice the serial computation).  Below that, and his
time*memory cost increases.  This is far from the punishment an attacker
would have if, for example, he tried using 1/2 the memory with t_cost &gt; 1
in Lyra2, if I understand correctly.
