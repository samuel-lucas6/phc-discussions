Excellent news.  I look forward to seeing the update!

&gt; Dear Bill,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the encouraging words on our design Rig. We sincerely
&gt; appreciate your comments. However, there is no need to apologize
&gt; for the previous comments once you do not accuse us of any
&gt; wrongdoing. Your earlier mails had raised some technical points as
&gt; well, and some comments on the code too. We agree that we did not
&gt; write the most efficient or most good looking code at the time of
&gt; the submission since we felt that this was only intended to be a
&gt; test implementation. Further, there was indeed a mistake in the
&gt; bit-reversal permutation as we used it. We would like to thank you
&gt; for carefully reading the code and pointing out the issues. We are
&gt; currently revising the document as well as the code. We intend to 
&gt; complete the work within this weekend and will post the revised
&gt; document and the code by Monday. Hope you and the PHC will consider
&gt; the revision within the scope, as we are only making slight changes
&gt; to the previous version. We are also detailing the document a lot.
&gt; Hopefully this will make it easier to understand how the design
&gt; prevents various attacks.
&gt; 
&gt; You had made a positive comment on the speed of Rig. We are happy
&gt; to inform that the new version of Rig code is "much" faster than
&gt; the one we initially submitted. We now have an optimized
&gt; implementation and as far as we can see, it is by far the "fastest"
&gt; entry in the PHC in software platforms. Our team put a lot of
&gt; effort in last few weeks to make the code this efficient.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for your mail.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, Sweta (on behalf of the Rig team)

&gt; The worst mistake I made during my reviews was accusing the RIG
&gt; team of trying to take credit for other people's ideas.  I still
&gt; feel very bad about it.  I was wrong, and I was the one being
&gt; dickish.  I strayed from attacking code into attacking authors, and
&gt; that was stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; The RIG team independently came up with two great ideas.  First
&gt; was using the reduced Blake2b round, including the exact code from
&gt; the original author, just like the Lyra2 team.  This is a *very*
&gt; high performance hashing function which makes RIG the clear speed
&gt; leader in the cache-timing resistant category.  Second was XORing
&gt; over data rather than overwriting it, strengthening their TMTO
&gt; defense without causing much slowdown.  This helps correct a
&gt; potential weakness covered by the Argon authors in their
&gt; cryptanalysis of Catena.
&gt; 
&gt; They also came up with the idea of writing only part of the hash
&gt; to memory, making it difficult to determine the Blake2b state.
&gt; This is similar to how Lyra2 writes only part of their sponge's
&gt; state to memory.  RIGs idea also can be used to reduce memory
&gt; usage, which in some cases could be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; The RIG team was creative and original.  Their code does need some 
&gt; fixes, but I look forward to their update.  I found nothing in my
&gt; code review that cannot be fixed with tweaks.  I certainly hope the
&gt; judges did not take my tirade about RIG looking similar to other
&gt; entries into account when picking round 2 candidates.
&gt; 
&gt; Before picking them for round 2, I would prefer to see a code
&gt; update, but assuming it fixes the one critical bug, they seem like
&gt; a strong entry to me, from a code point of view.
