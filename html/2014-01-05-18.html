Subject: Re: [PHC] Proposed timeline changes

Not that my opinion should hold much weight here - I'm just dabbling after
all - but the one thing said that I strongly agree with is that submitters
should be allowed to "borrow" each other's ideas in the second phase,
potentially making major changes to their algorithms.

&gt; &gt; Any objection?

&gt; No objections from me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However we won't accept submissions after the initial deadline. And
&gt; round
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 is about shortlisting a few submissions rather than receiving new
&gt; ones.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The game has to have rules :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do other panel members think?
&gt;
&gt; I think many (if not all) of us are going to learn a few things from
&gt; each other's submissions.  It is important to let us reuse this
&gt; knowledge in revised submissions, and this may require more than tweaks.
&gt;
&gt; I am also unsure of what qualifies as a mere tweak and what does not,
&gt; and whether adding an extra password hashing scheme variation or extra
&gt; mode of operation (e.g., a scripting language friendly one to a
&gt; submission previously friendly to native code only) falls under "tweaks"
&gt; or not.  (Obviously, I am assuming that the test vectors will differ.
&gt; If they don't, it's a mere implementation change, which is not in any
&gt; way limited by PHC rules.)
&gt;
&gt; The scripting language example is not an arbitrary one.  What I am
&gt; seeing so far is that all new designs being discussed so far focus on
&gt; native code only, so far.  Yet I think that given more time, having
&gt; received initial reviews/feedback, and having seen each other's
&gt; submissions, some of those same teams may come up with variations of
&gt; their schemes intended for scripting languages.  It just feels premature
&gt; to work on that yet.
&gt;
&gt; The game does have to have rules, but not necessarily the exact rules
&gt; outlined in the provisional timeline so far.  If you feel that we need a
&gt; round where we'd shortlist a few finalists, then I think we potentially
&gt; need an extra round (before the shortlisting) for the knowledge reuse.
&gt;
&gt; We might have a slightly better idea on whether the shortlisting round
&gt; is needed if we ask would-be submitters to announce their plans to
&gt; submit by/on the previously scheduled date of January 31 (so it won't be
&gt; a surprise to them that something is expected from them by then, and
&gt; it'd be a relief that less is expected and they have 2 more months for
&gt; the actual submissions).
