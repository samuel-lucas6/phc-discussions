&gt; I like this too. ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at your code, you're resolving the higher area-time vs. number
&gt; of thread synchronizations tradeoff differently than I did, though.
&gt; I suggested having just one extra synchronization point (between the
&gt; equivalent of SMix's two loops), whereas in your case the
&gt; synchronization is continuous and the number of times a thread will have
&gt; to wait for other threads' data to become available is not pre-specified.

Here's an even worse problem:

Your threads write "pages" of data, but do those pages correspond to a
whole number of physical pages on a given system?  This requires
page-aligned accesses and your "page" size being a multiple of the
underlying hardware page size.  You could say that, yes, you'd use
exactly 4 KiB pages on x86, and it would be sort of fine (although
arguably going for a smaller size like 1 KiB provides some security
advantage, if you could afford that).

However, modern x86 CPUs (and modern CPUs implementing other archs as
well) support larger page sizes as well, and e.g. the Linux kernel
supports transparent huge pages.  This means that once your allocation
grows large enough, you no longer know the underlying physical page
size!  On x86, the pages can become 2 MiB or even 1 GiB (depending on
how the system is configured).

Moreover, huge pages are a must to avoid cache thrashing by page tables
when doing random lookups over large allocations.  When testing with a
112 GiB "ROM", I am seeing an almost 4x performance difference between
4 KiB and 2 MiB pages (1900 c/s vs. 7300 c/s for password hashing, with
certain otherwise constant settings, by 32 concurrent threads on the 2x
E5-2670, 8x DDR3-1600 machine I had mentioned).  Even if your primary
target is currently a smaller machine and no pre-initialized "ROM", huge
pages are still highly desirable - e.g., I am seeing a ~20% speedup with
the same page size change on a Bulldozer with a 5 GiB allocation (filled
in only a few seconds, and with no "ROM").

If your "pages" do not correspond to a whole number of physical pages,
you'll run into false sharing between your threads when they happen to
write into the same page.  This can truly kill performance, and this
effect and its worst case extent won't be easily predictable.  Slowdowns
by many orders of magnitude are possible.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing</a>

Now, you could align to 2 MiB (on x86) and make this your "page" size,
but what if the system is configured for 1 GiB transparent huge pages?
Document this as unsupported?

I mostly avoid this problem, as long as N is large enough, by having
each thread fill its sub-region sequentially, and by having the reads
made only from the sliding window (thus, by the time a thread starts
writing near the end of its region, the next thread is most likely no
longer reading near the beginning of its region because its window has
likely already moved to start almost half way through its region).
That's in SMix first loop.

In SMix second loop, all threads only read (they do not write), which
also avoids false sharing.

An improvement, to deal with the risk of badly de-sync'ed threads, could
be to allocate each thread's region separately, with at least a physical
page gap inbetween them.  However, this is an implementation detail -
can be implemented or not, without affecting how the password hashing
scheme is defined.

In your case, if you don't want to give up on the idea of having just
one loop with frequent thread synchronization, you may have your threads
write each to its own sub-region (rather than interleaved, as I think
they do now), and calculate the page indices to read from differently
(from two sub-indices, which you'd derive from the current hash
separately and then combine into the index).
