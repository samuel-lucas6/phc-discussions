Subject: Re: [PHC] Argon2 improvement thread

Dear community,

So far we support most of the API and minor corrections to the scheme that
do not change its functionality and do not make it more complex.
Complexity, as we see it, is one of the greatest enemies of security.

=============MAXFORM============

The proposed MAXFORM modification as in
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2838" rel="nofollow">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2838</a> adds a  64-bit
transformation with a large number of S-box lookups that runs in parallel
to the primary 8192-bit transformation P.

The motivations behind this new transformation are to reduce the
parallelism and that certain number of sequential S-box lookups slows down
the brute-force on GPU on some settings.

The negative effect of this addition is fourfold:
 - new transformation, conceptually different from the other blocks in the
scheme
 - scheme becomes more complex and more difficult to analyze
 - increased exposure to side-channel attacks
 - wider gap between Argon2d and Argon2i, getting two schemes rather than
one.

Clearly, adding this type of structure requires careful analysis and clear
benefits. We would like to evaluate the effect of this update on the actual
GPU performance with various memory requirements. Thanks to Alexander, we
already know that the performance impact on CPU is not so large.

If there is anyone volunteering to code and benchmark Argon2d with and
without this update on some GPU likely to be used by a cracker, we would be
happy to assist. For instance, the GPU performance should be compared for
Argon2d with and without this update using 4 KB, 64 KB, 1 MB, 64 MB, and 1
GB of RAM.

Given the significance of the change, we consider it premature to integrate
without proper evaluation.

=========================Hybrid scheme===

It has been proposed to add another version of Argon2, which is a
combination of Argon2d and Argon2i. In more details, the first half (or so)
of the memory should be filled with data-independent addressing, and the
rest with data-dependent addressing. The motivation is to reduce the
side-channel leakage for 1-pass Argon2d  at the cost of reduced tradeoff
resilience and the overall latency. The drawback of this proposal is
threefold: 1) yet another primitive 2) the side-channel leakage is reduced
but not removed, which still restricts the use case. 3) the tradeoff
becomes more favourable to the attacker.

Clearly, such update would make sense only for 1- or 2-pass Argon2d, since
for 3 passes and more Argon2i comes into play. We think that the drawbacks
currently outweigh the positive effect, in particular we are concerned of
the fact that the scheme is weaker than both existing variants in some
scenarios. Still, it can be possible to include it as a possible extension,
though not recommended by the designers but available to those who
desperately want such a scheme.

===================================

We would be happy to see more discussion on these topics, in particular
from the panel members who have not expressed their opinion yet.

Kind regards,
the Argon team.
