Subject: Re: [PHC] Can I have two entries?

Regarding SAMS (Single-Author Multiple-Submissions), I agree with
Thomas' analysis.

We will accept all submissions that match the requirements, so in
theory one could submit 42 different functions. We'll just hate you
for that ;-)

On tweaks: submitters will be allowed to discuss/propose/announce
tweaks whenever they want, however it is planned that tweaks will only
be frozen and officially part of the submission after the finalists'
selection (as noted on <a href="https://password-hashing.net/timeline.html" rel="nofollow">https://password-hashing.net/timeline.html</a>).

Fixes to bugs/typos/inconsistencies will of course be accepted
anytime. But I don't expect those to be major reworks of the
submission. In this kind of competition, too many design iterations
tends to be counterproductive.

&gt;&gt; &gt; For non-trivial algorithms, good pseudo-code is not any easier to produce
&gt;&gt; &gt; than a machine-readable implementation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; how about trivial algorithms? btw any algorithm is easier to write in
&gt;&gt; pseudocode, especially compared to low level languages like c. i don't
&gt;&gt; think there is a real debate about writing pseudocode is significantly
&gt;&gt; less error prone than writing actual code. it is pretty much the
&gt;&gt; rationale behind using them.
&gt;
&gt; To me, pseudo-code is something half way between "human friendly yet
&gt; imprecise" and "machine-readable and more precise".  I'm not sure
&gt; regarding these being more or less error prone.  I guess it depends.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; they are also easier to read.
&gt;
&gt; Sometimes.  And yes, I said "human friendly" above, which is about this
&gt; "easier to read" aspect.  However, this is not always true.
&gt;
&gt; For example, I find scrypt's crypto_scrypt-ref.c more specific and in
&gt; some ways easier to read than the scrypt paper, which contains pieces of
&gt; pseudo-code.  Yet the paper is valuable to have in addition to the code,
&gt; because it clarifies other things that are not included or not explained
&gt; in the one implementation (even the reference implementation).  We need
&gt; both.  As to which to require for initial PHC submissions, if I were the
&gt; only one to decide, I'd require only the code, accepting specification
&gt; documents by a later date (although of course it'd be great if they're
&gt; submitted along with the code).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; It's sort of OK if initial PHC submissions have bugs;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; so what good a buggy reference implementation is? what is the added
&gt;&gt; value?
&gt;
&gt; I feel I'd be repeating.  It confirms that the algorithm exists and is
&gt; implementable, it allows to test its properties (to the extent the
&gt; hopefully minor bugs don't interfere with that), it allows us to better
&gt; evaluate complexity and efficiency of possible implementations.
&gt;
&gt; Efficiency is crucial.  We can't compare PHC submissions against each
&gt; other without considering their efficiency.
&gt;
&gt; For example, escrypt tries to ensure it's no weaker than bcrypt in terms
&gt; of attacks with GPUs, even at low memory settings.  The only way for me
&gt; to be reasonably confident of this claim I'm making is to actually run
&gt; an optimized implementation of escrypt on current machines and measure
&gt; the achieved frequency of random memory accesses and parallel groups of
&gt; accesses (two separate metrics) vs. those of bcrypt, and normalize for
&gt; the difference in S-box sizes where appropriate.  And guess what, this
&gt; goal was not fully achieved initially.  I had to go back and revise the
&gt; way escrypt is defined, a few times, until I finally achieved this goal
&gt; only a couple of days ago.  I produced several revisions of the
&gt; implementation in the process, but this wasn't even a substantial
&gt; portion of the effort involved.  Without the implementations, I would
&gt; end up making a false claim, or I'd need to give up on this desirable
&gt; property (not claim it and probably not achieve it).
&gt;
&gt; Maybe for your PHC submission it's different.  Maybe it has different
&gt; goals and claims, where efficiency is somehow not as crucial (e.g., it
&gt; might be sufficiently unique in other aspects that it's not directly
&gt; competing with any other schemes in terms of attack/defense speed ratio).
&gt;
&gt; Can we end this discussion, please?  You've stated your opinion.  I've
&gt; stated mine.  Let's move on.  We got real work to do.  Thanks!
