&gt; the primary advantage to salting today is the
&gt; factor of N slowdown in cracking. If you have 1M unique salts, then your
&gt; effective speed is 1/1000000 of your total speed. 30 GH/s becomes 30
&gt; KH/s. It limits the types and variety of attacks we can run.

I saw your post on Ars Technica trying to explain this to general public  
in the wake of their breach.  
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/2014/12/ars-was-briefly-hacked-yesterday-heres-what-we-know/" rel="nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/staff/2014/12/ars-was-briefly-hacked-yesterday-heres-what-we-know/</a>

It's an interesting case-in-point of explaining, what is the level of  
protection users should expect? In this case, the function provides a  
non-negligible cost to complete, but not a particularly high bar per  
individual guess. You mentioned a single R9 290X can pull ~ 12.2 GH/s on  
raw MD5, and here we have 2,048 iterations.

For the Ars hack, we have presumably a very large number of salted hashes  
leaked along with corresponding PII.

In a non-targeted attack, you gain the most cracked hashes per second on  
average, by trying each most probable password in sequence of expected  
popularity, on each remaining salt. For each pass, the input to the  
cracking function is the salts, everything else is fixed data. In this  
case the per-user hash rate is the single guess rate divided by the number  
of uncracked salts.

In a targeted attack, of course the salt is fixed, and becomes less  
relevant.

If your metric is "% of database cracked over time" then salting greatly  
effects that metric if the database is large. As you mentioned, for  
Forbes' 1M passwords, crack rate is down around 20%. The massive size of  
the breach--e.g. 1 million accounts--reduces the speed with which you  
advance to the next word in the dictionary. In this case, losing a lot of  
hashes at once helps users if the attacker is completely un-selective in  
their cracking.

But can we always make that assumption--that the attack will not be  
selective? If the metric is average latency to crack a single password,  
that metric is at all not sensitive to how large the leak is or the number  
of salts. It focused purely on the cost of hashing.

When might the target size be one? Well, for example, in a targeted or  
on-demand attack, versus the general case of an attacker trying to re-sell  
in bulk the weakest passwords in the database. In this case you might look  
at what is the average cost to crack just one account. You can't rely on  
hiding among millions of salts to make the attack slower.

Another way to look at it, what is the minimum amount of entropy a  
password would need under the hashing scheme to resist an offline attack  
given some assumed resource and time constraint? E.g. For 2,048 MD5, lets  
say I can target a single account with $10,000 of hardware and achieve 50  
MH/s, or 30 trillion guesses in a week's time, that's going to  
successfully crack what percentage of user-chosen passwords?
