Subject: Re: [PHC] Security concern for Catena

Although I didn't read the paper I did look at the images :). I don't believe
this attack works unless memory access is what it is on page 10 outputting at
the end of r1 (from the image below). I think they understand this attack and
this is their remedy (from page 18 of <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/525.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/525.pdf</a>):
&lt;-- hopefully this image shows up

&gt; 
&gt;  I just skimmed through the paper on Catena.  Not that my opinion counts, but
&gt; it's a very nice piece of work!  Many ideas in Catena are very close to what I
&gt; was looking for in password security.
&gt; 
&gt;  That said, I see a potential security flaw.  Let's say an attacker has a goal
&gt; of 100X reduction in the memory cost.  Let's assume the hash function is
&gt; SHA-256, and that V(i+1) = SHA-256(V(i)).  In the first loop, we fill memory
&gt; with the chained SHA-256 output.  An attacker has to compute it all.  Instead
&gt; of storing every memory location as he goes, he only stores 1 in 100
&gt; locations, saving 100X the memory area and bandwidth.
&gt; 
&gt;  In the second loop, he accesses memory in a random-ish but pre-determined
&gt; pattern.  Again, he must have the values at each of these random-ish locations
&gt; and is forced to recompute them from the saved SHA-256 data, which on average
&gt; will be 50 rounds of SHA-256 to provide the missing data.  So far, so good,
&gt; because our area*time has not changed by more than a small constant.
&gt; 
&gt;  However, because the attacker knows the next 100 memory locations that need
&gt; to be computed, he can have 100 SHA-256 hashing cores working in parallel to
&gt; provide the needed data, sort of like doing a memory prefetch.  Every cycle,
&gt; we just take an idle core and put it to work computing the SHA-256 data we'll
&gt; need in 100 cycles.  That core will have enough time if it produces one
&gt; SHA-256 hash per cycle.  By the time the attacker needs the data, it's ready
&gt; and waiting for him.
&gt; 
&gt;  This whole custom ASIC uses 1/100th of the external memory and bandwidth, but
&gt; has 100 on-chip SHA-256 hashing cores.  Maybe that many cores costs a bit of
&gt; die area, but it's tiny compared to the multi-GB of RAM that the attacker may
&gt; have saved.
&gt; 
&gt;  This attack is what originally convinced me that the memory-read pattern has
&gt; to depend on the password.  Now I'm not so sure.  If Catena were modified to
&gt; work like NoelKDF, it just might stop such an attack.  In particular, instead
&gt; of filling memory with a simple hash chain, why not add a random-ish previous
&gt; value to the hash in addition to the prior value?  If you do this, and an
&gt; attacker keeps only 1 out of 100 SHA-256 hashes, he's in trouble.  To generate
&gt; V(i+1) he needs V(i) which is no problem, but he also needs V(random-ish value
&gt; &lt; i).  Using the bit reversal of i, then right-shifting until it's less than i
&gt; might work as the index for a random-ish prior value.  Even better, use
&gt; Alexander's sliding power-of-2 window to convert the bit reversal of i into
&gt; the random-ish address with a bitwise AND and addition.  If the attacker does
&gt; not have that value saved, he'll have to recompute it, and unfortunately for
&gt; him, he'll need the prior value to that plus the random-ish prior value.  This
&gt; blows up exponentially, and he'll have to recompute most missing values &lt; i.
&gt;  This is how NoelKDF is secure from this attack.
&gt; 
&gt;  I see no way for an attacker to reduce memory by 100X and avoid having to
&gt; recompute most of the missing values for each V(i).  Each value, instead of
&gt; depending only on the prior value, now is the result of a tree-like DAG of
&gt; prior values.  He needs a full DAG cut to recompute the output.  Over half of
&gt; the last half of values depend on the first half of values, and a cut of the
&gt; DAG for computing the lasts value at the middle would have an insane number of
&gt; of edges.  They would point to over half of the first half of memory.
&gt; 
&gt;  If you guys agree with my attack and potential solution, I'll try to
&gt; prototype it this week in NoelKDF.  It would be pretty cool to eliminate the
&gt; timing attacks.  A side benefit of this scheme is that you no longer need the
&gt; second loop at all.  The run-time should be very similar to the original
&gt; Catena scheme, because you'll still need to do one write and one read per
&gt; memory location, and two hashes.  I still don't think there's any need for
&gt; something as solid as SHA-256 for the hash.  I'll try the one I'm currently
&gt; using that is just 4 operators: two additions, a 32-bit multiply, and an XOR.
&gt;  Another advantage of Catena/NoelKDF would be very high speed.  Another minor
&gt; gripe I have about Catena is that it has zero room for parallelism, other than
&gt; what the hash function has, and the completely random memory access will cause
&gt; runtime to be dominated by cache miss penalties.  By hashing "pages" of data
&gt; together rather than completely random locations, we eliminate most of the
&gt; cache-miss penalty, and by hashing random-ish "sequences" of sequential values
&gt; within those pages, we have a flexible way of tuning available parallelism to
&gt; the application.
&gt; 
&gt;  I don't want to sound down on Catena.  I would rave about the positives I saw
&gt; in that paper, but I've gone on too long already, and my opinion really
&gt; doesn't count much anyway.  I love the client/server split of responsibility
&gt; for the hash, and just about everything about Catena.  Like I said, it's very
&gt; nice work.  Hopefully my attack is BS, or we can fix Catena with a minor
&gt; change.
