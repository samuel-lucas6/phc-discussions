&gt; Here's my modified multiplication chain code.  It does two
&gt; multiplications per loop, and uses only the upper 32 bits, which are
&gt; harder to speed up in hardware than the lower 32:
&gt; 
&gt;                 // Compute the multiplication chain
&gt;                 for(uint8_t k = 0; k &lt; multiplies; k++) {
&gt;                     a ^= (uint64_t)b*c &gt;&gt; 32;
&gt;                     b += c;
&gt;                     c ^= (uint64_t)a*d &gt;&gt; 32;
&gt;                     d += a;
&gt;                 }
&gt; 
&gt; The 4 variables are initialized from the "state" values.  This
&gt; function allows the additions to be done in parallel, but the
&gt; multiplications and xors must be sequential.  It runs well on both 32
&gt; and 64 bit Intel architectures in my tests.

This looks very good at first glance, especially in terms of efficiency:
you only spend one cycle on top of the multiplication latency.

&gt; There is a multiplication poisoning issue, but with the 4 variables, I
&gt; have not seen it occur after a billion iterations, so the percentage
&gt; of blocks that would have poisoned chains is tiny.  The poisoning
&gt; would occur if a and c both become 0 or 1 at the same time.
&gt; Otherwise, if only a or c is 0 or 1, changes in b and d should kick
&gt; them back into higher values.

Is your use of four variables intended specifically to reduce the
frequency of such poisoning, or were there other reasons as well?

&gt; Will this do?

Probably.

Here's another thought I had, but didn't mention yet: what if the
attacker makes their multiplier circuit such that it's not constant
time, but rather that it may complete a cycle earlier in case the final
carry chain is interrupted (has 0's) in places allowing for such
speedup?  If sums of partial products for some of the output bits are
zero, then higher output bits don't depend on sums of partial products
for any bits lower than that.  This means that e.g. bit 63, which
potentially depends on everything due to this final carry, may in fact
be computed very quickly most of the time.

Higher 32 bits are probably in fact "harder" to speed up in hardware
than the lower 32, as you wrote, but once someone went for the effort of
this variable-time multiplier circuit, maybe it'd actually run faster
than it could otherwise?

I've been thinking that maybe the middle 32 bits (16 to 47) are actually
the slowest to compute, even in a variable-time optimized circuit, but I
could be wrong.  This is more of a gut feeling than careful analysis.
And on 32-bit archs this double-register shift may be costly.  On 32-bit
x86, right now you simply pick EDX instead of EAX, but if going for bits
16 to 47 you'd have a SHRD in there, wasting a cycle and thereby
probably killing any advantage this would provide.  On ARM, I think it'd
be even worse: LSR and OR-with-shift, meaning two cycles wasted.  (But
I'm not familiar with ARM.  I merely looked these up in arch reference.
Maybe there's a quicker way I overlooked.)  It's on 64-bit and on SIMD
with 64-bit vector elements that we incur a similar shift anyway, and
can adjust the shift count arbitrarily (be it 32 or 16).

Another consideration in deciding between &gt;&gt; 32 vs. &gt;&gt; 16 vs. &gt;&gt; 20 (or
21?) is that shifts by up to 20 (or 21?) only use multiplication result
bits computable in double-precision floating-point, making this more
JavaScript-friendly and maybe friendlier to some GPUs (such as high-end
NVIDIAs).  This has both pros and cons.  Since I do currently have an
arbitrary shift in a 64-bit value anyway (unlike you), this change is
within consideration for me (whereas it'd cost 1+ cycle of overhead for
you, so probably not worth it given that it has both pros and cons).
Maybe this shift count may be a parameter (choice between 32 and 20?)

I think you shouldn't make further changes to this now unless a major
problem is found.  I'm just rambling.  I'd be interested in your
comments, though, as this might affect my work on escrypt.
