Subject: Re: [PHC] Memory-hard proof of work with fast verification (CPU Hash)

The idea of using ROM for PoW with fast verification has been around since
2003 <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=65154" rel="nofollow">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=65154</a> (Section 5.1 for a
simple algorithm). The major problems are 1) this approach needs a long
initialization phase, and 2) the verifier must have as much memory at least
for the beginning.

We have recently proposed a new method for a memory-hard PoW with fast and
memoryless verification, where there is no initialization phase and the
verifier can be weak. It is in the Argon2 paper
<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/430.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/430.pdf</a> , Section 8. The technique can be used
with any memory-hard PHC finalist, in fact.

&gt; It turns out that Momentum has some devastating parallel attacks, and
&gt; should not be used.  IIRC, Cuckoo is also broken.  So, here's the outline
&gt; for a new algorithm I hope can help fix this situation.  As usual, I'll put
&gt; code on github.  I'm calling it CPU Hash for now.
&gt;
&gt; The algorithm is motivated from EARWORM, using the fix I proposed to
&gt; defeat distributed ROM attacks (increasing the state size).  It uses a
&gt; large random ROM (maybe 512MiB), and a fairly small RAM (20KiB).
&gt;
&gt; A large ROM is initialized with blocks of 4KiB each (this overcomes DRAM
&gt; latency issues caused by cache misses).  A fast block hash function
&gt; hashBlocks(digest, nounce, block1, block2) creates a new block from the
&gt; previous two.  I used a multiplication-chain compute-time hardened hash
&gt; function motivated from TwoCats/Yescrypt, followed by a cryptographic hash.
&gt;
&gt; The initial block is copied from the first block, ROM[0], and the digest
&gt; of the crypto-coin block and nounce (guess for solution to crypto-coin
&gt; block) are copied to the start of the memory block.  Block b[1] is then
&gt; hashed in with hashBlocks.  If the resulting block final HLEN bytes hashes
&gt; (with a cryptographic hash) to less than the difficulty setting, then
&gt; success, a solution is found.  The proof of work is simply the new
&gt; crpto-coin block and nounce that solves it.  Verification simply repeats
&gt; the hash of 20KiB, which runs in constant time.  Since only 20KiB are
&gt; hashed, and 8KiB is usually already cached (ROM[0] and ROM[1]), this should
&gt; be much faster than LiteCoin in blockchain verification,  Also, my block
&gt; hash is wicked fast :)
&gt;
&gt; The main advantage is that the ROM will large enough to require external
&gt; DRAM, while verification speed is faster than in LiteCoin.  I think this is
&gt; the combination needed to discourage ASIC based mining, and keep mining on
&gt; CPUs.
&gt;
&gt; Defeating GPU attacks is with the large ROM.  Scrypt achieves parity
&gt; somewhere around 4MiB.  This would be much larger, maybe 512MiB.
&gt;
&gt; Highly parallel distributed ROM attacks using custom ASICs would be
&gt; defeated by hashing random blocks three times, which would require that two
&gt; of the blocks be transmitted from one node to another other over a
&gt; network.  The network routing for 2 blocks should be slower than a CPU
&gt; reading 3 blocks from DRAM.  Hashing more than one block is required,
&gt; because with just one block the index could simply be transmitted to the
&gt; node owning the ROM block, and computation could be done entirely by the
&gt; destination node.
&gt;
&gt; The code is coming along, though the idea is only a few of hours old.
&gt; Maybe I'm too sleepy to think straight, but it seems to me that this is a
&gt; nice upgrade to the various crypto-coin PoW that are trying to make use of
&gt; memory-hard password hashing algorithms.  I'm too sleepy to see the flaws
&gt; at the moment.  Do you guys see any in this outline?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Bill
