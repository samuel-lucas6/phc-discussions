&gt; Assunto: Re: [PHC] Lyra2 initial review

&gt; Bill,

&gt; How did you calculate the "average memory/second" for Lyra2 and
&gt; yescrypt. I don't know about Lyra2's, but yescrypt's looks wrong to
&gt; me.

Actually an explanation would be really good, because I confess that, except for "memory bandwidth", I'm not sure I understand what those numbers mean or how to computed them... 

&gt; I think it is 5/8 of peak, since memory usage is growing linearly for
&gt; the first 3/4th of time, and then stays at peak for 1/4th.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Lyra2:
&gt; &gt; &gt; Peak memory/second: 1.63 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; &gt; Average memory/second: 1.22 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; &gt; Memory bandwidth: 11.4 GiB/s (highly bandwidth limited)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yescript:
&gt; &gt; &gt; Peak memory/second: 3.03 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; &gt; Average memory/second: 2.27 GiB/s

&gt; This would be: 3.03*5/8 = 1.89 GiB/s

&gt; &gt; &gt; Memory bandwidth: 6.06 GiB/s (does it do 2 r/w to DRAM per
&gt; &gt; &gt; location, or 3?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; yescrypt does 4 r/w per location when YESCRYPT_RW is set (and it is
&gt; &gt; set

&gt; No, that's wrong: it's 2 r/w per iteration. It would be 4 r/w per
&gt; location if SMix2 ran for as many iterations for SMix1, but in this
&gt; mode
&gt; it does not. I think correct is:

&gt; 3.03 * 4/3 * 2 = 8.08 GiB/s

&gt; 4/3 is ratio of number of iterations to number of locations
&gt; 2 is number of r/w per iteration

&gt; &gt; in the PHS() API), so this would be 12.12 GiB/s. It does one random
&gt; &gt; read and one sequential write per iteration in SMix1, and one
&gt; &gt; random
&gt; &gt; read+write per iteration in SMix2. (Resetting, YESCRYPT_RW brings
&gt; &gt; it to
&gt; &gt; only 2 r/w per location like in normal scrypt, but then it'd have
&gt; &gt; to run
&gt; &gt; 1.5 times longer to achieve optimal normalized area-time and it'd
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; friendly to TMTO, hence that mode isn't the default.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; TwoCats:
&gt; &gt; &gt; Peak memory/second: 4.98 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; &gt; Average memory/second: 2.49 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; &gt; Memory bandwidth: 9.97 GiB/s
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd interpret these as TwoCats and yescrypt winning over Lyra2 in
&gt; &gt; terms
&gt; &gt; of average memory/second, which I think is the most important of
&gt; &gt; three
&gt; &gt; metrics here. yescrypt loses to TwoCats in terms of this metric by
&gt; &gt; 8.9%,
&gt; &gt; but it possibly makes up for that by using 21.6% more memory
&gt; &gt; bandwidth
&gt; &gt; (some would view that as a drawback, but in this test we were
&gt; &gt; specifically
&gt; &gt; trying to use as much bandwidth from one thread as we could).

&gt; The 8.9% was based on your "average memory/second" figures. With
&gt; yescrypt's corrected, TwoCats' advantage is 24%, which is impressive!

&gt; I am surprised that Lyra2 and TwoCats seem to win significantly in
&gt; terms
&gt; of bandwidth usage. I doubt it's the cost of one round of pwxform
&gt; (although to find out we can try making it zero rounds, even). It
&gt; could
&gt; be the cost of r=8.

It is likely to have a relationship: we have a compile-time parameter "nCols" that has a similar effect to scrypt's "r". It is part of the algorithm's core rather than a "tweak", but it would not fit in the PHS interface... 

&gt; &gt; BTW, chances are that going from r=8 to r=16 (already a tunable,
&gt; &gt; like in
&gt; &gt; scrypt) would increase yescrypt's bandwidth usage (and average and
&gt; &gt; peak
&gt; &gt; memory usage per second) some further. I choose r=8 for PHS()
&gt; &gt; because
&gt; &gt; it increases reliance on fast small random lookups. r=32 and higher
&gt; &gt; might be faster or slower, since we're competing for L1 cache space
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; pwxform's S-boxes (8 KiB in these tests).
