I envy you. ;-)

&gt; There is only one minor issue nagging at me: the stripped-down subset
&gt; of TwoCats called SkinnyCat takes only a memCost parameter, not both a
&gt; memCost and a timeCost.  For compute-time hardening in SkinnyCat, I
&gt; would repeat the inner block hash loop 2^timeCost times rather than
&gt; using multiplication chains.  TwoCats, being the full featured
&gt; version, does both.  The idea is that repeatedly hashing the same
&gt; small block of memory that fits in L1 cache over and over before
&gt; moving to the next block is hard for an attacker to speed up, because
&gt; our L1 CPU caches are fast.  It also would allow SkinnyCat to be used
&gt; in low memory situations where long runtimes are still desired.

This specific approach to using timeCost sounds weird to me.  Maybe I
misunderstood, but as described above it sounds like timeCost &gt; 0 would
reduce the whole scheme's usage of memory bandwidth accordingly, which I
find an undesired side-effect.  Set timeCost high enough and attackers
would even be able to use disks instead of RAM.  No?

I actually thought of controlling yescrypt's time cost solely via the
pwxform rounds count (thus, within BlockMix rather than at a higher
level such as in SMix), but decided not to for the reason given above.
The pwxform rounds count should also be tunable (in the full-featured
implementations), but that's for other reasons: it changes the balance
between computation (along with L1 cache lookups) and memory bandwidth
usage, which may be desirable to tune as well.

&gt; On the other hand, many users are likely to get confused with 2 cost
&gt; parameters, and there is already some compute time hardness in
&gt; SkinnyCat due to it's high external memory bandwidth.  It also adds
&gt; complexity to SkinnyCats, which is antithetical to it's design goal.
&gt; 
&gt; I know this isn't terribly important.  I can probably change it in the
&gt; "tweaking" phase anyway.  What do you think?  Should a KISS PHS
&gt; include a time cost parameter?

I have the same dilemma for a scripting-language friendly KISS scheme
that I _might_ submit.  Either choice makes sense to me, although I
think supporting t_cost (via continuing to run for longer after the
desired amount of memory has been filled) is preferable.  In case the
way you can support higher t_cost is only as you described above (and
assuming I understood you correctly), then maybe don't bother. ;-(  What
you described sounds more like a way to tune computation vs. bandwidth
usage than a way to tune the time cost.  I'd even say that the effect it
has on time is a side-effect, and it'd be unfortunate to have people use
this setting for the sole purpose of achieving the side-effect.

I understand that you probably tried to keep the number of tunable
parameters to a minimum, in TwoCats as well.  This may be why you
arrived at only one parameter where there could have been two.
