&gt; S-box overwrites in BlockMix_pwxform may defeat the same kind of attacks

&gt; just as well

I mean it would still work just as well when no shuffling is done.
When shuffling is done as well, the S-box overwrites do also work
against "pipelining".  It's just that this combination of both
mitigations appears excessive, and the S-box overwrites appear to be
more effective on their own than shuffling does on its own.

&gt; - however, having to store or/and recompute (portions of)
&gt; the S-boxes may introduce enough extra storage needs or/and extra
&gt; latency that the attacks would not be worthwhile overall.

&gt; Here's what I am able to fit within +/-10% of yescrypt 0.7.1's
&gt; performance (mostly as tested for max threads at 2 MB per independent
&gt; instance, but also tested with other memory sizes and single thread):
&gt; 
&gt; Option 1: reduce PWXrounds from 6 to 5, but introduce a third S-box
&gt; (thus, e.g. 8 KB to 12 KB total) and rapid S-box writes inbetween rounds
&gt; (writing to the third S-box, which is inactive for reads at that time,
&gt; and then rotating the 3 S-boxes at each sub-block).

I've since managed to retain PWXrounds = 6 yet also add the third S-box
and the 4 stores.  Due to some other optimizations, this achieves about
the same performance as yescrypt 0.7.1 on Sandy Bridge and Haswell.
Unfortunately, not on Bulldozer: 4% (1 GB KDF) to 13% (2 MB password
hashing) performance impact there (most of it from going from 8 KB to
12 KB, and not from the stores).  Yet I think this is acceptable.

&gt; This means that 12
&gt; gather loads (6 rounds times 2 gather loads) are replaced with 10 gather
&gt; loads and 4 sequential stores.  (Counted in sub-block sized operations.)

Now it's 12 gather loads alone, vs. 12 gather loads and 4 sequential
stores (the stores are almost free in this code on these 3 CPUs).

&gt; The total L1 bandwidth usage increases by a factor of 7/6, and the GPU

Now it's 4/3.

&gt; local memory attack resistance by a factor of 3/2*5/6 = 5/4 (even
&gt; assuming the stores are somehow free, which they are not).

Now it's 3/2, assuming same speed as before (so not on Bulldozer, where
this improvement is smaller) and ignoring possible additional effect of
the stores.

&gt; Drawbacks
&gt; are that multiplication latency hardening decreases to 5/6, and that
&gt; GPU(-like) global memory attacks (if the S-boxes would be put in global
&gt; memory anyway) might become up to 6/5 times faster (again, assuming the
&gt; sequential and perfectly coalesced stores are somehow free).

These drawbacks no longer apply, except that the slight performance loss
on Bulldozer might help some attackers (those whose hardware would not
be impacted to at least the same extent - e.g., Intel CPUs).

&gt; Valid PWXrounds settings for this design are "a power of 2, plus 1", so
&gt; e.g. 2, 3, 5.

It's "a power of 2, plus 2" now, so 3, 4, 6, 10.

&gt; Option 2: since the above means introduction of "pwxform context"
&gt; anyway, it now becomes straightforward to add similar handling of a
&gt; larger S-box, targeting L2 cache.  Reduce PWXrounds from 6 to 4,
&gt; introduce a third small S-box (thus, e.g. 8 KB to 12 KB total) like
&gt; above, and introduce a 128 KB S-box also including the smaller 3
&gt; S-boxes as its part.  Have the rest of the larger S-box (beyond the
&gt; 12 KB holding the smaller S-boxes) lazy-initialized during the main SMix
&gt; operation (keep the current bitmask in the pwxform context).  Unlike the
&gt; above, perform only two S-box writes per sub-block: one write to the
&gt; currently inactive small S-box (which gets activated at next sub-block,
&gt; like above), and one write to the remainder of the large S-box.  (This
&gt; means maintaining a sequential write offset for the larger S-box, and
&gt; masking it for writes to the smaller S-box.)  These are the extra
&gt; actions in two of the four rounds.  In two other rounds, the extra
&gt; actions are cache line sized random lookups against the large S-box.
&gt; Alternatively, random lookups against the large S-box are performed in
&gt; all four rounds

I've since managed to introduce multiply-adds into the L2 cache reading
rounds as well, so the total multiplication latency hardening remains at
6 (or even becomes 8) per sub-block while achieving similar performance
as before.

The remaining major drawback is that the random lookups become less
frequent - there's still the rounds count reduction from 6 to 4 in that
respect.  For GPU attacks that placed the S-boxes in global memory
anyway, this reduction in frequency of random lookups would result in a
speed advantage.  With 6 rounds, 2 active S-boxes, and 4 gather lanes,
we had 48 random lookups per sub-block.  With 4 rounds, we have just
32+2=34 or 32+4=36.  (Counting the L2 lookups the same as L1 ones here,
as they would be similar if all are done from GPU global memory anyway.)

This may well be the primary reason why I probably won't go for
introducing an L2 layer into yescrypt now.  Other reasons include the
complexity increase, and the design starting to look specialized
rather than generic.

That's a pity, as having an L2 layer in the arsenal of defenses could
help against some attack hardware, including specific GPUs that would
have preferred to use local memory otherwise.

&gt; This requires attackers to either provide 128 KB of (semi-)local memory
&gt; per instance, or transfer that data off-chip.  The latter approach would
&gt; increase the attack chip's external bandwidth needs by a factor of 2.5.
&gt; (We had 1 read and 1 write per block, so 2 total.  Now we also have 2
&gt; reads and 1 write to the large S-box, so 5 total.  In fact, in the
&gt; Haswell-enabled variation pasted above, it's 4 rather than 2 reads from
&gt; the large S-box, so 7 total, and a 3.5x increase.)
&gt; 
&gt; The choice of 128 KB is since it's how much L2 cache we have per thread
&gt; on many modern CPUs.  Bulldozer could do more (1 MB L2 per "core"),

I tested that Bulldozer works reasonably well for up to 512 KB used as
yescrypt's L2 per thread.  There is performance decline relative to
smaller sizes, but it's not sharp (until the 512 KB to 1 MB increase).

&gt; Knights Corner/Landing would probably need less (256 KB per 4 threads,
&gt; so 64 KB).

I wrongly listed Knights Landing here - apparently, it will have 1 MB of
L2 cache per 2 cores, so 128 KB per thread.

&gt; 128 KB works great on Haswell, but is a few percent slower
&gt; than 64 KB on Sandy Bridge; I don't know exactly why (maybe something to
&gt; do with when L1 lines also have to be present in L2, although neither
&gt; CPU has L2 forcibly inclusive of L1, as far as I could find).

Also, 128 KB results in lower and less stable speeds than 64 KB when
using a large ROM (multi-GB on huge pages).  Maybe the page table
entries significantly benefit from being in L2 rather than in L3, or
something.

&gt; So what do we prefer - the more elegant option 1 (with crazy frequent
&gt; S-box writes, because we can?) or the more extensive option 2?

I am leaning towards staying with a variation of option 1 at this time.
