&gt;&gt; Catena focuses on an unrealistic weak attack against Scrypt: aborting
&gt;&gt; the second loop early using cache timing.
&gt;
&gt; We never claim that the cache-timing attacks against scrypt are practical.

I hope I didn't imply otherwise.  It is a very interesting attack, I
enjoyed reading it, and it is now something I worry about in looking
at a KDF, where before I didn't.  It was quite educational.

&gt;&gt; However, an attacker still has to execute the full compute
&gt;&gt; intensive first loop, so we're not talking about speeding anything up,
&gt;&gt; just saving memory.
&gt;
&gt; False.
&gt;
&gt; The regular cost to check an password candidate is
&gt;     T(n) = O(N^2) / S(n).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Our attack allows to check password candidate with
&gt;         T(n)  =  O(N)/ 1.
&gt;
&gt; This is an dramatic improvement and it invalidates the memory-hardness
&gt; assumption of scrypt. It enables  a GPU attacker to test password
&gt; candidates in an "very efficient" way.

I appreciate your taking the time to correct me, and sorry for posting
mistakes.  What I said was only true (to within a small constant) only
for an attacker using the same amount of memory as Scrypt per core (S
== G), and who is CPU limited, not memory bandwidth limited.  Your
cache timing attack allows him to perform thousands of guesses in
parallel on graphics cards, where before he would have been memory
bandwidth limited otherwise.  It's a brutal attack when cache timing
is obtainable.

However, each core still has to finish the whole first loop, which
still takes significant time.  If an attacker gains access to early
hashed memory, he not only doesn't have to have significant memory per
core, but he can avoid computing much of the first loop.  It's a lot
worse in terms of how many guesses a graphics card can compute per
second, and it's also, IMO, more likely of an attack.

Does Catena have an option for something like Blakerypt's session
keys?  If the password is first hashed with a "session key", and the
attacker doesn't know the session key, brute force attacks become
impractical, even with leaked early memory and cache timing
information.  I'd hate to see such defense dropped from the
competition.  Maybe it's already in use all over, but as I said, I'm a
password hashing noob.  I simply don't know.  It just seems like a
great defense for servers.
