Subject: Re: Security concern for Catena

Anyone notice that this site went down for a few hours right after I posted
this?  This seems to happen on Saturdays and Sundays when I post any new
crypto-related idea to a crypto-related site.  I posted on a Saturday to
the TrueCrypt list and it was down all weekend.  I think I may have a
personal poltergeist who doesn't have the skills to realize when my posts
are harmless, but to CYA, he shuts down the site until a bigger brain can
review it.  I know... too paranoid...

&gt; I just skimmed through the paper on Catena.  Not that my opinion counts,
&gt; but it's a very nice piece of work!  Many ideas in Catena are very close to
&gt; what I was looking for in password security.
&gt;
&gt; That said, I see a potential security flaw.  Let's say an attacker has a
&gt; goal of 100X reduction in the memory cost.  Let's assume the hash function
&gt; is SHA-256, and that V(i+1) = SHA-256(V(i)).  In the first loop, we fill
&gt; memory with the chained SHA-256 output.  An attacker has to compute it all.
&gt;  Instead of storing every memory location as he goes, he only stores 1 in
&gt; 100 locations, saving 100X the memory area and bandwidth.
&gt;
&gt; In the second loop, he accesses memory in a random-ish but pre-determined
&gt; pattern.  Again, he must have the values at each of these random-ish
&gt; locations and is forced to recompute them from the saved SHA-256 data,
&gt; which on average will be 50 rounds of SHA-256 to provide the missing data.
&gt;  So far, so good, because our area*time has not changed by more than a
&gt; small constant.
&gt;
&gt; However, because the attacker knows the next 100 memory locations that
&gt; need to be computed, he can have 100 SHA-256 hashing cores working in
&gt; parallel to provide the needed data, sort of like doing a memory prefetch.
&gt;  Every cycle, we just take an idle core and put it to work computing the
&gt; SHA-256 data we'll need in 100 cycles.  That core will have enough time if
&gt; it produces one SHA-256 hash per cycle.  By the time the attacker needs the
&gt; data, it's ready and waiting for him.
&gt;
&gt; This whole custom ASIC uses 1/100th of the external memory and bandwidth,
&gt; but has 100 on-chip SHA-256 hashing cores.  Maybe that many cores costs a
&gt; bit of die area, but it's tiny compared to the multi-GB of RAM that the
&gt; attacker may have saved.
&gt;
&gt; This attack is what originally convinced me that the memory-read pattern
&gt; has to depend on the password.  Now I'm not so sure.  If Catena were
&gt; modified to work like NoelKDF, it just might stop such an attack.  In
&gt; particular, instead of filling memory with a simple hash chain, why not add
&gt; a random-ish previous value to the hash in addition to the prior value?  If
&gt; you do this, and an attacker keeps only 1 out of 100 SHA-256 hashes, he's
&gt; in trouble.  To generate V(i+1) he needs V(i) which is no problem, but he
&gt; also needs V(random-ish value &lt; i).  Using the bit reversal of i, then
&gt; right-shifting until it's less than i might work as the index for a
&gt; random-ish prior value.  Even better, use Alexander's sliding power-of-2
&gt; window to convert the bit reversal of i into the random-ish address with a
&gt; bitwise AND and addition.  If the attacker does not have that value saved,
&gt; he'll have to recompute it, and unfortunately for him, he'll need the prior
&gt; value to that plus the random-ish prior value.  This blows up
&gt; exponentially, and he'll have to recompute most missing values &lt; i.  This
&gt; is how NoelKDF is secure from this attack.
&gt;
&gt; I see no way for an attacker to reduce memory by 100X and avoid having to
&gt; recompute most of the missing values for each V(i).  Each value, instead of
&gt; depending only on the prior value, now is the result of a tree-like DAG of
&gt; prior values.  He needs a full DAG cut to recompute the output.  Over half
&gt; of the last half of values depend on the first half of values, and a cut of
&gt; the DAG for computing the lasts value at the middle would have an insane
&gt; number of of edges.  They would point to over half of the first half of
&gt; memory.
&gt;
&gt; If you guys agree with my attack and potential solution, I'll try to
&gt; prototype it this week in NoelKDF.  It would be pretty cool to eliminate
&gt; the timing attacks.  A side benefit of this scheme is that you no longer
&gt; need the second loop at all.  The run-time should be very similar to the
&gt; original Catena scheme, because you'll still need to do one write and one
&gt; read per memory location, and two hashes.  I still don't think there's any
&gt; need for something as solid as SHA-256 for the hash.  I'll try the one I'm
&gt; currently using that is just 4 operators: two additions, a 32-bit multiply,
&gt; and an XOR.  Another advantage of Catena/NoelKDF would be very high speed.
&gt;  Another minor gripe I have about Catena is that it has zero room for
&gt; parallelism, other than what the hash function has, and the completely
&gt; random memory access will cause runtime to be dominated by cache miss
&gt; penalties.  By hashing "pages" of data together rather than completely
&gt; random locations, we eliminate most of the cache-miss penalty, and by
&gt; hashing random-ish "sequences" of sequential values within those pages, we
&gt; have a flexible way of tuning available parallelism to the application.
&gt;
&gt; I don't want to sound down on Catena.  I would rave about the positives I
&gt; saw in that paper, but I've gone on too long already, and my opinion really
&gt; doesn't count much anyway.  I love the client/server split of
&gt; responsibility for the hash, and just about everything about Catena.  Like
&gt; I said, it's very nice work.  Hopefully my attack is BS, or we can fix
&gt; Catena with a minor change.
