Subject: Re: [PHC] Scripting memory (not so) high vs Catena in PHP (with optimizations)

This is very helpful.  Thank you!

&gt; Current scripting memory (not so) high vs current Catena:
&gt; 2 MiB: 544 ms vs 2030 ms (3.73x)
&gt; 1 MiB: 249 ms vs 1040 ms (4.17x)
[...]
&gt; Optimized scripting memory (not so) high vs optimized Catena:
&gt; 2 MiB: 431 ms vs 995 ms (2.31x)
&gt; 1 MiB: 195 ms vs 499 ms (2.56x)

I was getting ~560 ms for 10 hashes at 1 MiB on i7-4770K.  Your Q9300 is
maybe up to twice slower, but you're reporting twice lower time.  Yet if
it was for just one hash computation rather than 10, then it'd be much
lower.  So I am puzzled.

I've attached a new revision of smhkdf (still highly experimental, work
in progress).  It is about twice faster than the first revision, mainly
due to reduced iteration count in the last loop.  With $k &gt; 1, that loop
doesn't need as many iterations; rather, to maximize ASIC area*time, we
want the memory filling and memory using loops to run for roughly the
same amount of real time.  (Another aspect, though, is that for attacks
with e.g. CPUs we may want to optimize for greater SHA-512 efficiency,
even if it reduces the AT cost somewhat.  For this reason, maybe the
optimal iteration count for the last loop needs to be somewhere inbetween
of what I had in the first revision and in this new one.)

This new revision also discourages TMTO to a slightly greater extent.

On i7-4770K, the speed at 1 MiB is 37 c/s for 1 instance, 136 c/s
cumulative for 8 concurrent instances.  Can you benchmark it on your
system, including against your Catena scripts?

&gt; Scripting memory (not so) high:
&gt;         $ja = unpack('V', $x);
&gt; vs
&gt;         $ja = unpack('V', substr($x, -4));

I've included this change now.  The reason for substr($x, -4) was to
prevent an optimized (non-PHP) implementation from prefetching the next
block a few steps (3 steps, I think) before completing the SHA-512
computation.  But if this costs us too much in terms of PHP overhead,
let's omit it.  Besides, such prefetching may be helpful for defensive
native code implementations as well.

&gt; The optimized version's look ups are aligned to 384 bytes with a $blocksize of
&gt; 384 bytes vs byte aligned with a $blocksize of 431 bytes. Note both require four
&gt; SHA512 blocks.

The alignment is both good and bad.  It improves code efficiency, but it
means that fewer previously computed blocks are needed to compute the
new one.  Having a dependency on one extra block due to misalignment
(which occurs most of the time) makes us slightly more TMTO resistant.

&gt;         $m_cost = ceil($blocksize / 64);

I chose to use right shifts instead of floating-point division followed
by ceil() or floor().

&gt;     $v = array();

BTW, if we do that, we can also discourage TMTO by random writes in the
last loop:

<a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/crypt-dev/2013/11/20/1">http://www.openwall.com/lists/crypt-dev/2013/11/20/1</a>

I think the same is not easy to do on a string, where substr() can only
be used on the right hand side, right?  We're lacking an equivalent of
Perl's vec() in PHP, right?

I think PHP arrays are always associative (they use hash tables), which
means they're somewhat inefficient for our needs here.  Right?

I'm not very familiar with PHP.
