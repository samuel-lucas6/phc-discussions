&gt; I made a mistake on the memory bandwidth computation.  I forgot to add in
&gt; the 2 reads and 2 writes on average per location in the wandering phase.  I
&gt; should have multiplied by 7 instead of 3!  The fixed numbers are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.47GiB/s of memory hashing (.57GiB/.39s) peak
&gt; 1.10GiB/s average
&gt; 10.3 GiB/s DRAM bandwidth
&gt; 
&gt; That bandwidth is close to maxed out for one thread on my machine.  12GiB/s
&gt; seems to be about the limit (EARWORM maxes out at 12GiB/s, with a far
&gt; simpler inner loop).

Bill, this sounds cool, but let's not forget that maximizing single
thread's memory bandwidth usage is a goal only in a subset of use cases
(in 1 out of 3 categories, as I tried to explain earlier), whereas in
others it's actually a drawback (it means that other resources are not
fully made use of for defense when the defender is running more than one
thread).  yescrypt's defaults (most notably, pwxform rounds count) have
been tuned such that it achieves nearly its highest memory bandwidth
usage only when the number of concurrent threads gets close to what is
supported in hardware.  I think it makes sense to make the rounds count
tunable, so that it'd be possible to maximize single thread's memory
bandwidth usage when desired - but this isn't made a tunable parameter
in the currently submitted yescrypt yet.

When comparing against scrypt or yescrypt in terms of single thread's
memory bandwidth usage, I think we need to compare against reduced
rounds versions of scrypt and yescrypt.  This means scrypt with 2 rounds
of Salsa20 (just delete 3 out of 4 uses of SALSA20_2ROUNDS from
SALSA20_8_BASE in yescrypt-simd.c) and yescrypt native mode with 1 round
of pwxform (just delete 5 out of 6 uses of PWXFORM_ROUND in PWXFORM).

A hashing scheme pretending to win solely(?) in these terms would need
to show that it outperforms these trivial modifications of [ye]scrypt.
And there's not a lot of room to outperform them, even when we do, as
we're getting quite close to the available bandwidth.

I don't think single-thread performance is such a good metric for
comparing default settings (including hard-coded parameters) of the
different hashing schemes now.  Easy to achieve, but why and what's
next?  I can answer the "why" for a subset of use cases, though.

It is a better metric for comparing the potential of reduced-round
versions of the different hashing schemes, to see how we may tweak them
for use cases where optimization in these terms is desirable.

For context, here's an excerpt from a message I wrote last month:

Subject: Re: [PHC] TigerKDF paper and code ready for review

[...] I think all 3 of these cases are important, and
should be considered when designing a KDF/PHS:

1. Single-threaded, single instance runs.  This is what happens in apps
that choose not to use threads for whatever reason (or lack thereof) and
need to generate a key for en/decrypting some data.

2. Multi-threaded, single instance runs.  This is what happens in apps
like above, but which do enable threads.

3. Single-threaded, multi instance runs.  This is what happens on
authentication servers.  The multiple instances may be threads in the
authentication service, or they may be separate processes, or they may
even be in different VMs.  Whatever they are, the settings of our
password hashing scheme should be chosen such that sufficient capacity
for concurrent authentication attempts is achieved.

Maybe optimizing for multi-threaded or/and multi-instance case (#2 or #3
above) is more important than for single-threaded, single instance case
(#1 above), because this is two use cases vs. one.

I would actually be (somewhat) interested if you do this sort of
comparison for Lyra2 vs. scrypt with Salsa20/2 vs. yescrypt with 1 round
of pwxform (and, if you like, also with Salsa20/2 instead of /8 for the
final, real crypto sub-block per block).  I wrote "somewhat" because I
expect all of these to be similar, since we're getting close to full
memory bandwidth available from one thread in hardware. ;-)

Thank you for helping review PHC candidates!
