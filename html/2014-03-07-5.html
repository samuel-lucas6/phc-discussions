Subject: Are password trailing 0's a problem?

I noticed that any password used in PBKDF2 gives the same result as
that password with 0's appended any number of times up to a total
length of 64 bytes.  Is this a problem?  A way around this would be to
add the password length to the data hashed.  Since I always call
PBKDF2 with c ==1 (1 repetition), this is the only input parameter
which can change without changing the output.

Another concern about PBKDF2 is that it calls HMAC_Init with the
password, and if for some reason the password is &gt; 64 bytes, it is
passed to the PRF directly, resulting in a very early call with
runtime proportional to the password length.  Of course, the length is
&gt; 64, which is insanely long, so perhaps that's a secure enough
password, but an attacker might gain useful information such as
whether the long-password guy has logged in lately.

Then of course there's the chosen input attack on PBKDF2 where an
attacker gains some potential advantage by choosing adjacent values of
c for two logging attempts.  I also dislike that PBKDF2 generates
n-bit output when it's strength is never higher than 256 bits, and
that it makes a useless second call to HMAC when c == 1.  It also
bothers me that we can't clear the password until PBKDF2 has
completed, and for large c, that could be a while.  This just seems
dumb to me, but obviously, designing these things are very hard, or we
wouldn't get standards like PBKDF2 with flaws.

I'd just abandon PBKDF2 and use HMAC with "tweak" including input
lengths, but I'm too worried I'll mess up and create a weakness.
Blake2s seems to be begging me to use it to simplify HMAC, since the
"inner" and "outer" hash states are not needed for Blake2.  I see the
Catena author had more confidence, and just called the PRF directly,
but I see he calls it with the password and salt, and that the runtime
of this call will be proportional to the combined length.  Can this
give an attacker knowledge of the password length?  I think I'd rather
have the trailing 0's have no effect problem... It also concerns me
that the user's data is passed directly to H in Catena, meaning
there's a chance an attacker might gain knowledge of the data length.
My favorite uses for data include adding a secondary key, so I'd
prefer to protect data as strongly as a password.

If I did roll-my-own, like Catena, I'd do something similar, hashing
in a fixed size "tweak" that contains the input parameters, and I'd
use a 256 byte pad on all variable sized inputs rather than 64 for
just the password.  I only allow lengths up to 255 (uint8_t) on
purpose, to avoid having to deal with crazy input lengths securely.

I believe this would eliminate danger from guessing lengths based on
runtimes of calls to hash input data, insure the output is always
different when any input bit changes (unlike PBKDF2 - trailing 0's on
a password make no difference).

Thoughts?  Is it crazy to worry about PBKDF2 and even HMAC?  How dumb
is rolling your own?

Bill
