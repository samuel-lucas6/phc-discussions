&gt; Solar observed that to split the arena into W=4 sections,
&gt; and divide it across multiple machines, each of which needs
&gt; only the first section and one other.

Grammar fail. That should read "Solar observed that it was possible
split the arena into W=4 sections and divide it across multiple
machines, each of which needs only the first section and one other."

&gt;&gt; In this case, each ASIC would split up it's portion of the ROM into
&gt;&gt; 4096 1MiB "chunk areas" in external DRAM.  It would also store up to
&gt;&gt; 4GiB/64 = 64Mi password scratchpads, each representing a password
&gt;&gt; guess in progress.  As it loads it's 4096 chunk areas sequentially,
&gt;&gt; over and over, it computes all the workunit updates with as much
&gt;&gt; parallelism as the ASIC can support, maybe 100-ish or even 1000-ish
&gt;&gt; AESENC cores, pipelined maybe 6 deep.  That would be 600-ish to
&gt;&gt; 6000-ish AESENC executed in parallel per ASIC, or around 150K to 1.5M
&gt;&gt; in total, applying AES-128 hashing to all of it's 512-bit scratchpads
&gt;&gt; that are waiting on that specific chunk area to be applied.
&gt;
&gt; This attack seems to be exploiting the grid-aligned structure of
&gt; EARWORM's arena, in which chunks begin at discrete 1MiB boundaries.
&gt; There was another thread here in which Solar observed that to split
&gt; the arena into W=4 sections, and divide it across multiple machines,
&gt; each of which needs only the first section and one other.  I suggested
&gt; then that you could prevent this by collapsing the arena's three
&gt; dimensions into one and making possible for chunks to begin at any
&gt; point along that dimension.
&gt;
&gt; So instead of
&gt;
&gt; for l from 0 to L-1
&gt;     for w from 0 to W-1
&gt;         scratchpad[w] = AESRound(arena[index][l][w], scratchpad[w])
&gt; index = scratchpad[0] mod 2**m_cost
&gt;
&gt; we'd have
&gt;
&gt; for l from 0 to L-1
&gt;     for w from 0 to W-1
&gt;         scratchpad[w] = AESRound(arena[index++], scratchpad[w])
&gt; index = scratchpad[0] mod (2**mcost * L * W)
&gt;
&gt; and add one extra chunk to the arena (for a size of (2**m_cost + 1) *
&gt; L * W blocks) so that this doesn't overflow.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't make this change because I didn't view Solar's attack as a
&gt; threat within my model. This one, however, is a horse of a different
&gt; color. It seems that the same change would make your attack much more
&gt; expensive, because if you can't partition the ROM into discrete chunk
&gt; areas, then the routing complexity increases enormously. Do I have that
&gt; correct?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; One reasonable defense against this attack would be to do memory-hard
&gt;&gt; writes as well as reads, to maybe a few MiB per password hash.  This
&gt;&gt; would cause my evil machine to need maybe 1000X more memory than I
&gt;&gt; described, memory bandwidth would likely become the bottleneck, and
&gt;&gt; the hypercube communication network might get overloaded.
&gt;
&gt; This would be a much more substantial change. The resulting design
&gt; would look more like yescrypt than like the current version of
&gt; EARWORM. I'm not going to go there, and I wouldn't expect the panel to
&gt; let me get away with it if I tried.
