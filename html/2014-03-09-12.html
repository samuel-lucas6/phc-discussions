Subject: Re: [PHC] KDF vs PHS?

Bill,

PHS = Password Hashing Scheme, the term used on
<a href="https://password-hashing.net/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://password-hashing.net/index.html</a>. It's not perfect but it's the
best we found then. KDF is obviously worse, as key derivation (that
is, producing a cryptographic key from a password) is only one of the
applications of password hashing.

&gt; Should we be calling our password hashing entries PHSs or KDFs?  I'm
&gt; not sure people know what to call these things, and that makes it
&gt; difficult to even discuss them.
&gt;
&gt; I see the acronym PHS on the password hashing.net site twice, with no
&gt; definition, and Google doesn't seem to know it.  Is it Password
&gt; Hashing System?  If so, I like it better than KDF, and would propose
&gt; we start calling them that.  I see Scrypt calls itself a KDF, while
&gt; Catena calls itself a Password Hashing Framework, which seems
&gt; completely different, even though they are very similar and both very
&gt; different than PBKDF2 or HKDF.  In fact Scrypt calls PBKDF2 as a
&gt; lower-level primitive.  How can it also be a KDF?
&gt;
&gt; KDF has the word Function in it, implying rather simple functionality,
&gt; and when I look at standards (or just "Informational" publications)
&gt; like PBKDF1, PBKDF2, and HKDF, I see definitions like this:
&gt;
&gt; PRK = HMAC-Hash(salt, IKM)
&gt;
&gt; These KDFs seem to be very basic cryptographic primitives, where we
&gt; can write them if a few lines of code and then debate them for years.
&gt; I don't see how they can be compared to Scrypt, accept from a user
&gt; point of view where he has to select one in a drop-down menu, and we
&gt; would like him to see Script right along PBKDF2-SHA256 and Bcrypt.
&gt;
&gt; I wrote an upgraded version of HKDF yesterday.  I abused the name HKDF
&gt; yesterday and and called my function HKDF2 because I was too lazy to
&gt; come up with a new name, and HKDF2 does get across my intention that
&gt; it be an upgraded version of HKDF, rather than something completely
&gt; new.  HKDF2 unfortunately implies the authors came out with a new
&gt; version, so I think I'll have to come up with something else.
&gt; "Enhanced HKDF" or EHKDF?
&gt;
&gt; That feels like a the right sort of label.  It took a day to think
&gt; about what functionality was needed, and a couple hours to code.  I
&gt; could be write the document tomorrow and be done, other than the
&gt; enormous effort at standardization which frankly I'm too lazy to
&gt; attempt.  I feel comfortable comparing it to other KDFs like PBKDF2.
&gt; However, I would not compare it to Scrypt.  It's something that a
&gt; password hashing system like Scrypt would call.
&gt;
&gt; In fact, I'm hoping we can have a discussion about all calling the
&gt; same (or similar) KDF primitive as a pre-process to our password
&gt; hashing systems.
&gt;
&gt; There... that felt good.  With different labels, I can discuss them in
&gt; the same sentence while making sense!  What would people think if I
&gt; propose that we all adopt a common KDF and call it as a pre-process to
&gt; our KDFs, and that we be allowed to "tweak" our KDFs to use a
&gt; different KDF during the KDF tweaking period of the KDF competition?
&gt; Because that's exactly what I'm proposing, and I'd like to be able to
&gt; say it and be understood at the same time.
