Subject: yescrypt pre- and post-hashing

Bill, all -

I added (HMAC-)SHA-256 pre- and post-hashing to yescrypt, enabled
whenever it deviates from classic scrypt compatibility via any setting
(any feature flag or/and non-default time cost).  The attached patch for
the reference implementation illustrates this.  (I also made similar
changes for the optimized scalar and the SIMD implementations, but
there's no need to post those in here as well.)

I'd appreciate your comments.

In particular, is it a good idea to enable this on any (other) deviation
from classic scrypt, without requiring that this feature itself be
requested explicitly?

Is it good to only enable this feature on any (other) deviation from
classic scrypt, without supporting any way to enable just this feature
while keeping everything else as in classic scrypt?

The pre-hashing is a simple SHA-256 of the password prior to passing it
to scrypt's first PBKDF2.  This matches what PBKDF2's HMAC would do
anyway for passwords of 65 chars or longer.  In other words, this
matches what would be happening if HMAC were defined to always invoke
SHA-256 on the key, regardless of key length.

This pre-hashing serves two purposes:

1. Avoid the trivial "collisions" discussed in here, where a &gt;64 chars
password and its SHA-256 hash would have produced the same yescrypt
hash.  This is no longer the case, except in scrypt compatibility mode.

2. Ability to upgrade raw SHA-256 hashes, which unfortunately are in use
by some sites, to yescrypt hashes.  The specific choice of SHA-256 is
simply because it's used in (ye)scrypt anyway, but it happens to be
somewhat relevant for such upgrades.  Indeed, this sort of upgrades are
always possible, but now for raw SHA-256's the resulting hashes would be
genuine yescrypt hashes, with no need to record that they've been
upgraded from raw SHA-256.  (For upgrading anything else to yescrypt,
such info would still need to be recorded.)

Another relevant change is that first block of output from the first
PBKDF2 call is now preserved (during most computation) in place of the
original password, and is rolled into the final PBKDF2.  This change
serves two purposes:

1. Not only password entropy, but also salt entropy, is (by)passed into
the final PBKDF2, so that even if the memory-hard portion of yescrypt
catastrophically fails to preserve entropy, both the password and the
salt affect the final hash anyway.  This way, it can be said that
yescrypt's cryptographic security depends solely on that of SHA-256,
HMAC, and PBKDF2, but not on any of its heavy/custom/complicated parts.
For scrypt, the same can be said for the password, but not for the salt.
A catastrophic failure of SMix (and below) would potentially result in
scrypt having easy collisions for same password with different salts.
This is no longer so for yescrypt.

2. It is possible to zeroize the password early on, keeping only the
PBKDF2(SHA-256(password), salt) during most computation.  (I did not
include this in the code yet, but now it's a matter of implementation.)
Of course, PBKDF2 at 1 iteration is quick, yet it's better than
plaintext, and better than a saltless hash.

If desired, a tunable parameter may now be added to make it multiple
iterations of PBKDF2 for this first block.  In terms of code, a
separate instance of PBKDF2 would need to be invoked for 256-bit
derived key size, and it would just happen to produce the same results
as the current code when the iteration count is set to 1.  Before this
change, hacking in more PBKDF2 iterations relative to classic scrypt
would unnecessarily waste CPU time on additional PBKDF2 output blocks.

The post-hashing allows for most computation to be done on the client
while producing the same yescrypt hashes that are produced with 100%
server-side computation.  This is similar to Catena's "Server Relief".
I implemented it in a way that fits SCRAM (RFC 5802) to the extent
possible, so that existing yescrypt hashes stored on a server (sometime
in the future) would happen to be usable with a straightforward
extension of RFC 5802 (to appear at an even later future time).

BTW, there's some nice confusion in RFC 5802 regarding the order of
arguments to HMAC().  Tweets:

&lt;solardiz&gt; In RFCs, is it HMAC(msg, key) (per RFC 2104's code) or HMAC(key, msg)? RFC 5802 <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802#page-8" rel="nofollow">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802#page-8</a> vs. Dovecot <a href="http://hg.dovecot.org/dovecot-2.2/file/d55ae5d268a2/src/auth/mech-scram-sha1.c#l223" rel="nofollow">http://hg.dovecot.org/dovecot-2.2/file/d55ae5d268a2/src/auth/mech-scram-sha1.c#l223</a>
&lt;solardiz&gt; I guess RFC 5802 assumes HMAC(key, msg). Is the ordering of HMAC() args specified in an RFC? <a href="http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-scram.c#n346" rel="nofollow">http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-scram.c#n346</a> <a href="http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-utils.c#n43" rel="nofollow">http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-utils.c#n43</a>
&lt;+&#64;...f&gt; @solardiz Well, the source code in Krawcyk's RFC does M(msg, key) :)
&lt;@solardiz&gt; @tqbf Right. So RFC 5802's use of HMAC() looks inconsistent with RFC 2104. Either that, or multiple implementations got it wrong.
&lt;@solardiz&gt; @tqbf It's easy to verify RFC 5802's intent, though: it includes test vectors. I just don't have time right now. Anyone?
&lt;solardiz&gt; Impls of RFC 5802 with its test vectors, thus presumably tested: <a href="http://bm2.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1222/trunk/src/login/SASL_ScramSha1.java" rel="nofollow">http://bm2.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1222/trunk/src/login/SASL_ScramSha1.java</a> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sco0ter/babbler/src/6e5daf195414/src/test/java/org/xmpp/sasl/?at=default" rel="nofollow">https://bitbucket.org/sco0ter/babbler/src/6e5daf195414/src/test/java/org/xmpp/sasl/?at=default</a> Confirms HMAC(key, msg)
