Hash: SHA1

On 08/23/2014 12:01 PM, Solar Designer wrote:
&gt;&gt; TrueCrypt volumes are currently essentially indistinguishable
&gt;&gt; from true random data (with some unfortunate caveats mentioned in
&gt;&gt; the audit). Because TrueCrypt has to open volumes with no idea
&gt;&gt; what the encryption parameters might be, TrueCrypt currently
&gt;&gt; tries every combination of supported encryption and password hash
&gt;&gt; to see if any work. That's OK, because it only takes a few
&gt;&gt; milliseconds to do them all. However, with multiple memory-hard
&gt;&gt; options, guessing the correct one could take too long. In this
&gt;&gt; case, I think Catena's "garlic" could work for us. We would have
&gt;&gt; TrueCrypt first try all the old combinations and when they fail,
&gt;&gt; we would guess a low garlic level appropriate for a mobile phone,
&gt;&gt; and then increase the garlic until we either would use more
&gt;&gt; memory than the machine has or run for too long. If the password
&gt;&gt; is correct, this should only take about twice as long to discover
&gt;&gt; the correct garlic level.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds unnecessarily wasteful.  You could as well actually
&gt; use the too-small-garlic hash values as input to the higher-garlic
&gt; hash, just like Catena itself does internally.

Good point.  That way an attacker can't just guess the most likely
setting - he has to go through the whole set of sizes.  I'll do it
this way instead.

&gt; In fact, you can extend this approach to parameters other than
&gt; memory cost.  You can also keep increasing the instruction, SIMD,
&gt; and thread parallelism along with each(?) higher memory cost
&gt; setting you test. (And this does not mean actually running more
&gt; threads, etc. than your hardware supports - indeed, you're not
&gt; forced to actually make use of the parallelism as such on every
&gt; hash computation.  You'll just use your hardware optimally.)
&gt; 
&gt; For example, currently you can use:
&gt; 
&gt; 128 MiB, 128-bit, 1 thread 1 GiB, 512-bit, 4 threads 4 GiB,
&gt; 512-bit, 8 threads 16 GiB, 512-bit, 16 threads
&gt; 
&gt; with each stage's result input to the next stage, until you either
&gt; hit the right password or hit a configured memory limit.

This is basically what I suggested on the TrueCrypt forum a year ago.
 It certainly would be an improvement to do it this way.

I forgot to mention that I want an option for multi-threaded hashing.
 Pepper doesn't work out as well.

&gt; If the KDF has configurable cache-timing attack resistance, you can
&gt; keep it enabled for the first invocation (or two) and disable it
&gt; for the rest (so you get a hybrid scheme as a result, except on the
&gt; smallest systems).

That's another good idea.  It could just be a pre-process, like a
cache-timing resistant 128MiB hash to start.  That way even a cell
phone gets some protection from unpredictable addressing.

&gt;&gt; Another problem is we face because of our no-visible-parameters
&gt;&gt; rule is that we can't support a lot of memory-hard hash
&gt;&gt; functions. Therefore:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; - - Please choose *one* high-memory usage successor to Scrypt
&gt; 
&gt; That's flawed logic.  PHC choosing multiple winners that are
&gt; suitable for your use doesn't mean you actually have to support
&gt; multiple schemes. You can choose just one, irrespective of PHC
&gt; panel's decision.
&gt; 
&gt; There are other good reasons for PHC not to inflate the number of 
&gt; winners.  Your reason is just not among those, in my opinion.

You're right again.  The PMC should pick exactly one winner for each
specific category.  TrueCrypt falls into the volume-encryption
category.  Another would be the authentication server category.
