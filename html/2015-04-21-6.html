&gt; &gt; It appears that Argon2 uses modulo division with arbitrary (and
&gt; &gt; changing) divisors (usually not powers of 2).  Argon2d applies this to
&gt; &gt; secret-dependent integers.  This is an extra source of timing leaks, on
&gt; &gt; top of secret-dependent lookup addresses.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do we consider this a drawback?
&gt;
&gt; Generally, small integer division algorithms that are not constant-time
&gt; have a running time that depends on the length of the operands, but not
&gt; on the actual values. Thus, if you need to compute x % y while hiding
&gt; the length of x, then you can compute (x + k*y) % y  with a suitable
&gt; constant k (preferably a power of 2...). For instance, if x is a secret
&gt; integer in the 0..0xFFFF range, then set k = 2^16. This won't hide the
&gt; size of the divisor (y), but it should make execution time (and
&gt; conditional branch pattern) independent of the actual value of x. The
&gt; cost of the extra shift-and-add should be small compared to that of the
&gt; division.
&gt;

I do not consider this to be a limitation of Argon2d, though Lyra2 (and
TwoCats) does protect against related attacks with it's password
independent first loop.  However, there are some tin-foil hat attacks I do
worry about, which could be effective against any algorithm without
cache-timing attack resistance, including Argon2d and Yescrypt, but not
against Lyra2.

The mod operation on platforms that do byte-wise division would run faster
1 in 256 times, just randomly, producing a useful timing signature for an
attacker.  However, every entry in the competition already calls memcpy on
the password, which also provides password dependent timing information,
and very usefule information - the password length.

The assumption in this competition has been that the attacker does not have
such high resolution timing information that he could determine the
password length from memcpy timing.  While attacks that could make use of
this sort of timing mostly use oscilloscopes on the power rails, there are
other possible atttacks.

For example:  Intel's hardware RNG has an undocumented mode for producing
raw data output.  I believe their design may be very sensitive to power
supply noise, and could give an attacker sub-nanosecond resolution of
whether the power rails are increasing or decreasing (a strig of 1's means
power is sloping one way, 0's means the other way) - enough to see the
length of a memcpy or other operation that hogs memory bandwidth.  It also
might be able to detect a mod operation delay.

However, a mod operation in modern hardware is fast compared to an L3 cache
miss.  Password dependent hashing will generate an easily observed power
rail waveform due to inactivity in the CPU during a cache miss.

In short, only the cache-timing resistant algorithms (Catena and Argon2i)
are at all resistant to an attack with power rail information.

Worrying about Intel's hardware RNG being used to monitor the power rails
is a bit silly - it's probably much more useful as a way to control the
output of the RNG and PWN your crypto.  However, CPUs have incorporated
power rail oscilloscopes directly on the die for decades.  We had one in
the HP SPECTRUM PN-10 CPU I helped debug back in 1988.  It required a
repeating power rail waveform to work, but modern CPUs likely can do it on
one go.  Back then we had to design the whole CPU with around 180,000
transistors.  Given billions, the oscilloscope design is fairly simple (a
triangle wave feeding a bunch of latch-based comparators with buffers
providing delays between their control inputs).  On the positive side,
accessing those modes hopefully requires at least the same runtime
priveledge as accessing page tables and such, assuming they aren't
purposely back-doored...

So, I don't think this mod operation in itself is that big of a deal.  The
timing attacks in general worry me a bit, but not enough to switch to a
fully resistant algorithm like Catena or Argon2i.
