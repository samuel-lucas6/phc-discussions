&gt; My comments should not carry much weight compared to the guy's who've
&gt; already chimed in, but I did read your code.  It is well written, and
&gt; as a guy who reads a ton of more typical open source code, I really
&gt; appreciate that.

Thanks Bill! I'm not a very good programmer, so I try to make my code as
easy to read as possible so it's easier for other people to find my bugs
:P  Ok, that's not entirely true. But I do feel that code that is
intended to be shared publicly should be well-presented.


&gt; I liked the gen-salt concept, which is new to me.  I
&gt; was thinking that managing all the parameters for a sophisticated PHS
&gt; is a lot to put on a user, and given your KISS oriented entry, I like
&gt; that this was the feature that you put a few extra lines of code into.

Thanks. The concept is not new, there is such functions in bcrypt and
other crypt(3) algorithms, phpass, etc. But there is some uniqueness in
mine, in that the cost settings are encoded with the salt.


&gt;&gt; As the name implies, pufferfish is an improvement upon bcrypt, and ergo
&gt;&gt; blowfish. Concisely stated, pufferfish modifies the blowfish algorithm
&gt;&gt; to use 64-bit words, a 128-bit block size, and dynamic s-boxes. The
&gt;&gt; reference implementation uses a fixed key size of 256 bits, simply
&gt;&gt; because for these purposes there is no need to support different key
&gt;&gt; lengths.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The dynamic s-boxes are of course the biggest differentiating factor
&gt;&gt; between pufferfish and blowfish. The s-box generation is as follows:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Hash the raw salt as sha512
&gt;&gt; 2. hmac-sha512 the password using the hashed salt as the key
&gt;&gt; 3. hmac-sha512 the password again, using the output of the hmac
&gt;&gt; operation in step 2 as the key
&gt;&gt; 4. These two hmac hashes are concatenated to initialize the 1024-bit state
&gt;&gt; 5. The four s-boxes are each filled with m_cost / 4 / sizeof (uint64_t)
&gt;&gt; words by iterating over the internal state with a variant of chacha8
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The state is then iterated 64 more times with chacha8 to generate a
&gt;&gt; third hmac key, which is used to hmac-sha512 the password one more time
&gt;&gt; to generate the inital encryption key.
&gt; This seems a bit complicated to me for a nice simple password hashing
&gt; function.

I suppose it might seem complicated, but the whole initialization
process described above can be implemented in about 15 lines of code. So
it's not *that* complicated. In pseudocode you could describe it in even
less lines:

half_state := hmac-sha512 (sha512 (salt), password)
state := hmac-sha512 (half_state, password).state
foreach sbox do
    for i := 0 to 3 do
        for j := 0 to m_cost / 4
            chacha8 (state)
            sbox[i][j] := state
do 64 times
    chacha8 (state)
key := hmac-sha512 (state, password)

That said, I will consider simplifying this a bit. I had selected
chacha8 to fill the sboxes since it is a lot more lightweight than
sha512, and I didn't want this part of the algorithm to be the most
expensive part. For example, if we used sha512 instead of chacha8 to
fill the s-boxes, an m_cost of 64, we'd need 1024 iterations of sha512.
That's really heavy for just the initialization. But, it could indeed be
simplified by just doing something like:

state := hmac-sha512 (sha512 (salt), password)
foreach sbox do
    for i := 0 to 3 do
        for j := 0 to m_cost / 4
            sbox[i][j] = sha512 (state)
key := hmac-sha512 (state, password)
  
But while it is less steps, it's also a lot more expensive. I'll
experiment with it, but I really don't see a need to be so compute-heavy
during the initialization phase.


&gt;&gt; The rest of the construction is largely identical to bcrypt, using the
&gt;&gt; same eksblowfish algorithm. However, to support variable output lengths,
&gt;&gt; the 256-bit ciphertext is hashed with sha512 after being repeatedly
&gt;&gt; encrypted before being written to the output buffer.
&gt; Similar to my thoughts above, do you need to go the extra mile in
&gt; hashing the output blocks?  If I read the code correctly, you're doing
&gt; 64 rounds of hashing on the internal key state, and then using SHA512
&gt; to hash it one more time to become part of the output result.  Don't
&gt; we trust SHA512 enough to just send it your internal key state and a
&gt; counter?  Wouldn't that be just as secure?

No, it's doing 64 rounds of pufferfish encryption in ECB mode, and then
using sha512 to hash the output. It's not strictly necessary, bcrypt
just uses the output of blowfish in ECB mode directly, but as the
modifications I made to blowfish to create pufferfish have not been
thoroughly reviewed, it is an extra safety step and doesn't cost much.


&gt;&gt; I elected to use this design because I really like bcrypt, and I really
&gt;&gt; like the idea of being memory hard while using as little memory as
&gt;&gt; possible. And I believe that the modifications I have made increase the
&gt;&gt; effectiveness and extend the longevity of the original bcrypt design.
&gt; Other people on this list also seem impressed by Bcrypt.  I haven't
&gt; read it yet :-(

Read it! :) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm</a>

The reason people are impressed with it is because it is memory hard
while only using 4 KiB of memory. Even though it fits nicely in L1
cache, it's still more efficient on CPU than GPU due to the
data-dependent psuedo-random memory accesses. I'm a big fan of bcrypt, I
think it's brilliant. But it's also 16 years old. It's definitely aged
very well, but there are some areas which can be improved. It looks like
solardiz and I disagree on where those improvements should occur, but I
think we are in agreement that being able to increase the memory cost is
a good start.


&gt; I guess extending bcrypt into the future is a good thing.  I'm not a
&gt; fan of sticking to tiny memory sizes that either fit in L1 cache or
&gt; barely bust out.  I'd rather make an attacker pay for multiple GiB of
&gt; memory for a full second per guess, but I understand there is a need
&gt; for in-cache hashing.

One of the biggest problems with this approach is adoption. As both
Peter Maxwell and I discussed in this thread:

<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/593/focus=601" rel="nofollow">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/593/focus=601</a>
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/593/focus=603" rel="nofollow">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/593/focus=603</a>

It's enough of a struggle as is to convince even well-respected industry
experts that they need to use expensive salted and iterated algorithms,
let alone the general IT public. Telling them that they also need to
dedicate multiple gigs of memory for the hashing operation will be
complete turn-off to a lot of people -- myself included. It's a hard
sell, and so far I haven't bought into it. The opinion you've expressed
is a very popular one on this list right now, but officially consider me
a dissinter :)  I'd much rather use as few resources as possible to
accomplish the same goal.
 

&gt; My concern over people going the Bcrypt route is that we may soon see
&gt; commodity multi-CPU chips with as many as 1024 independent processors,
&gt; all capable of computing Bcrypt rapidly.  You can defeat that by
&gt; hashing 1MiB or more, so that each processor will not have enough
&gt; local memory, but Bcrypt's 4KiB seems like the ideal target for these
&gt; new multi-CPU chips.

Agreed. Hence, pufferfish :)

&gt; Modern GPUs may have trouble, but Bcrypt has
&gt; nothing I've seen so far to make me feel confident in using it to
&gt; protect my passwords over the next 10 years.

Right. So, you know, pufferfish ;)


&gt;&gt; The reference code is clear, concise, and extensively commented, so it
&gt;&gt; should easy to read, especially if you are already familiar with
&gt;&gt; blowfish and/or bcrypt. I welcome your feedback.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - epixoip
&gt; The reference code is both clear and concise.  Very nice!

Thank you! And thanks again for your comments, Bill.
