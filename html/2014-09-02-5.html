Hash: SHA1

Clearly I was wrong to simply bypass Schvrch.  It has multiple flaws
which if not fixed render the algorithm not worth further discussion,
IMO.  That, plus seeing the author defend the flaws rather than
correct them lead me to believe we should spend our time focusing on
other algorithms.

For example, the author defends his decision to only use 2KiB of
memory during the entire time that t_cost is applied.  This is a
critical flaw, which mostly eliminates the utility of t_cost for
password defense.

Here is how I would attack Schvrch's t_cost parameter:

A user wants to protect his password.  He decides to use a 1 second
Schvrch hash, and 4MiB of memory, hoping that the 4MiB scrambling for
a whole second will do a decent job without interfering too badly
hogging external DRAM bandwidth.  An attacker sometime later obtains a
copy of the password database, and attempts to crack his password.  I
understand ASICs better than GPUs, so I'll assume the attacker has a
custom ASIC for cracking Schvrch.

In this case, the ASIC can have a similar cache capable of holding the
4MiB.  It is the largest part of the die by far.  Fortunately for the
attacker, he wont have to waste a whole second per guess of his
valuable large cache guessing this password.

Instead, the attacker executes 200 revolve cores in parallel, using a
total of only 400KiB of memory, which is small compared to the main
cache.  Ever 5ms, his cores generate a new state ready for attack
using the main cache.  Fortunately for the attacker, the rest of
Schvrch accesses his large cache only a few times, less than 8, and he
completes each 4MiB hash at a rate of over 1 byte per clock, which is
easily done given the 8-byte data paths.  Even with a 1ns latency to
his cache, his memory intensive portion only takes 4ms.

This simple device does a password guess every 4ms, compared to a
defender's 1 second.  No external DRAM is required.  Each board would
probably have 100 of these ASICs, generating guesses at a rate of
20,000 per second.

Compared to Scrypt, this is more than 10X worse.  The flaw seems to be
that the author does not understand the concept of memory*time
password defense.  You only get to count the memory for the time it is
required.

For a 117 line program Schvrch packs a in a lot of mistakes.  I
haven't even finished describing problems with the t_cost loop.  In
reality, an attacker would not bother implementing the whole revolve
loop in hardware, because it can be considerably simplified.  I'll
describe that in another post.

I hope it is clear that flaws like this are not acceptable.

If the author refuses to acknowledge this major flaw in his t_cost
implementation, and continues to defend it, we should simply stop
discussing Schvrch and move on, IMO.

Schvrch has several flaws, and I literally will have to write 4X more
lines of email than the program has lines.  I was hoping to avoid
that.  I will describe the next flaw in another email, so we can keep
the threads per flaw separate.
