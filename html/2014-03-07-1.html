Subject: TigerKDF paper and code ready for review

I still have to do a bit of work on the paper, but it's nearly ready:

    <a href="http://waywardgeek.net/TigerKDF.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://waywardgeek.net/TigerKDF.pdf</a>

The code is on github and can be checked out with:

    git clone git://github.com/waywardgeek/tigerkdf.git

I suspect TigerKDF, my 3rd major rewrite in 2 months, may be
competitive.  Solar Designer keeps pushing me to make it so, and for
some reason I feel like I need to do what he says...  The paper goes
into more detail than I should probably write down, but the highlights
are that TigerKDF:

* Fills and hashes memory rapidly - 1/2 as fast as memmove
* Hardens runtime through sequential multiplications
* Provides strong defense against GPU, FPGA, and ASIC attacks
* Reduces time-memory trade-off options
* Defends against cache-timing attacks
* Use parallelism for improved protection
* Offers protection in case of leaked memory
* Is suitable for desktop PCs, web servers, mobile, and embedded applications
* Supports client independent updates
* Supports server relief
* Performs well hashing many GiB of DRAM, or a few KiB of cache

Of course, that's just fluffy sales material.  Maybe more interesting
is the list of specific features I chose to include, with credits to
who I think is the culprit behind each idea.  Upgrades include:

1. A sequential multiplication chain to compute-time harden the algorithm
against ASIC attacks (Solar Designer &amp; Bill Cox)
2. Larger blocks than hashlen to reduce cache miss penalties (Scrypt)
3. Hashing between lanes in between block hashes to mix data and introduce
cryptographically strong hashes now and then (Solar Designer)
4. SSE/AVX2 parallelism to hash 8 chains in parallel (Solar Designer)
5. Small unpredictable reads to thwart GPU attacks (Solar Designer)
6. Repetitions parameter to increase compute time for memory-limited
systems (Solar
Designer &amp; Bill Cox)
7. A "resistant" loop before the "unpredictable" loop to harden
against cache-timing
attacks (Catena)
8. Inter-thread memory hashing to thwart TMTOs (Solar Designer)
9. Thread level parallelism to take advantage of multi-core CPUs (Scrypt)
10. Client-independent update (Catena)
11. Protection against memory leaking to attackers by overwriting
early memory (Bill Cox)

I also took a cue from Catena and simplified the API so there aren't
many parameters to tweak.  The "full" api is:

bool TigerKDF_HashPassword(uint8_t *hash, uint8_t hashSize, uint8_t
*password, uint8_t passwordSize,
    const uint8_t *salt, uint8_t saltSize, uint8_t *data, uint8_t
dataSize, uint8_t startMemCost,
    uint8_t stopMemCost, uint8_t timeCost, uint8_t parallelism, bool
clearPassword);

TigerKDF simultaneously does a multiplication based hash in the main
CPU registers, while doing SSE/AVX2 rapid parallel memory hashing in
the SSE/AVX2 unit.  It uses a "sliding-power-of two bit-reversal"
memory read pattern in the "resistant" loop, and a rand^3 read pattern
in the "unpredictable" second loop.  These both tested as best in my
pebbling benchmarks.  The algorithm hashes 2GiB on my i7-3770 machine
in 0.32 seconds, with 2 threads.  The memory hashing algorithm uses
Blake2s for cryptgraphic hashing between blocks, and a simple
non-cryptographic add/rotate/xor hash to fill memory.  I've done more
work trying to analyze it's security, and I think it's pretty good,
though I remain a non-expert at such things.

I had a couple new ideas, but basically my PHC entry would stink
without the upgrades suggested on the PHC forum.  I think it now no
longer stinks, and may even be a competitive entry.  Thanks for all
the feedback!

Bill
