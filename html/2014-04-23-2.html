Hi Bill,

If you alternate AES rounds with message injection on the full state,
collisions can be found instantly.

It is a non-trivial task to make a secure AES-based hash function, and
there have been many attempts during the SHA-3 competition. All of them are
not that fast.  One of problems is that the 128-bit state can provide only
64-bit security against collision attacks, which is certainly not
recommended.

I do not understand what you're doing in the last two paragraphs. A
pseudocode would help.

Bets regards,
Dmitry

&gt; Sorry about going slightly off-topic for this list, but certainly there
&gt; are experts here who will see the flaws in this idea.  Basically, I'm
&gt; wondering if we can use a memory buffer to considerably speed up
&gt; computation of secure file hashes using reducing rounds, without giving up
&gt; any security.
&gt;
&gt; I was trying last night use the new AESENC instruction to compute file
&gt; hashes very rapidly.  There are probably more problems with AESENC, but a
&gt; major one is that a single round (one AESENC instruction) is by itself not
&gt; cryptographically secure.  It normally requires 10 rounds to produce a 128
&gt; bit encrypted result, plus a lot of mucking with round keys and such.  When
&gt; I use AESENC to encrypt a "state" using sequential 16-byte blocks of the
&gt; message as the key, I don't think the resulting hash is secure.  Being a
&gt; speed freak, I love it's speed!  I am able to compute a digest of a random
&gt; 512MiB file in 68 milliseconds!  The file was already cached, of course.
&gt;  Being secure would be a plus in this situation...
&gt;
&gt; To find a collision, an attacker only has to figure out how to modify two
&gt; adjacent blocks of 16 bytes of the file in such a way that it results in
&gt; the same encrypted state 2 AESENC instructions later.  While that is likely
&gt; difficult, it is nowhere near the effort of doing that if we had performed
&gt; the full AES algorithm each 16 byte block.
&gt;
&gt; What if we do a simple post-process on the sequence of states generated?
&gt;  Just fill a memory buffer with the computed 16-byte state values,
&gt; incrementing by say 128*16 every time, so that we have to make 128 passes
&gt; over the memory to fill it.  This insures that state blocks which are near
&gt; each other in memory are vastly separated computationally, by very many
&gt; rounds of AESENC.  Once the block of memory is full, feed it into the
&gt; original simple AESENC loop, using sequential blocks of 16-bytes from the
&gt; buffer as the key.
&gt;
&gt; This takes 2 AESENC instructions per 16 bytes of output, and probably
&gt; busts into L2 cache, but I bet it's still very fast.  As with EARWORM,
&gt; running 4 parallel tracks of AESENC speed things up considerably.  I've
&gt; probably messed up a number of details, but can such an algorithm provide
&gt; the same security of other 128-bit cryptographic hashes, while running much
&gt; faster?  The same scheme could be (and maybe I'll write this) used with
&gt; Blake2b, doing 1 round of Blake2b rather than 8, filling memory as above,
&gt; and doing a 1 round hashes of the buffer when full.  The last partial
&gt; buffer could be processed in the usual way, with full rounds.  I think it
&gt; would run amazingly fast.  We'd be doing an average of 2 rounds rather than
&gt; 8 per 32-byte block.  Would it be secure?
&gt;
&gt; Bill
