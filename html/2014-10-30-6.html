&gt;&gt; Hi, Jacob.  This is a nice analysis.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Bill,
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you!
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; You misread TwoCats.  It is easy to do, which is one reason I
&gt;&gt; wrote SkinnyCat, which indeed is vulnerable to both GC and WGC
&gt;&gt; attacks. However, TwoCats has strong defense against both.  I
&gt;&gt; would argue that TwoCats has the strongest GC and WGC defense of
&gt;&gt; all the entries.
&gt; 
&gt; The attacks for skinnycat are clear. For twocats, we totally agree
&gt; that it is strong against GC attacks (we just misread that the
&gt; early memory within twocats is always overwritten). But, regarding
&gt; WGC attacks, we still see the attack as described in the paper.
&gt; According to our definition of a Weak Garbage-Collector Attack an
&gt; algorithm is vulnerable, if it maintains a function $F$ with $y =
&gt; F(pwd)$, where the value $y$ is later used in the hashing process.
&gt; Thus, $y$ has to remain in memory during the time until it is used
&gt; again at the end.
&gt; 
&gt; For twocats (and skinnycat), the value $y$ is given by PRK, which
&gt; is initialized with the password. PRK is later used in the
&gt; function addIntoHash(PRK, state). Thus, it has to remain in memory
&gt; and can be used by a WGC adversary to filter password candidates as
&gt; described in the paper.
&gt; 
&gt; Did we misunderstood something?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I think so.  addIntoHash mixes state into PRK, not the other
&gt; way around, overwriting the PRK.  This inside the garlic
&gt; application loop. The PRK is overwritten much faster than in
&gt; Catena, for instance.
&gt; 

OK. I just had a close look to your code and now I am convinced. I
just overlooked that PRK is overwritten for each increment of the
garlic factor, which, when starting with MinGarlic = 0, is indeed at
an early stage of the hash generation, rendering WGC attacks not
applicable. Nevertheless, if I understood your code and explainations
right, skinnycat does not support the parameters startMemCost and
stopMemCost and thus, the proposed WGC attacks on the value PRK seems
to work.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; By default, Catena runs with minGarlic == maxGarlic == 18.  In
&gt;&gt; this mode, Catena does not begin to overwrite memory derived from
&gt;&gt; the password until it has finished filling memory.  During this
&gt;&gt; entire time, H(H(key material)) is present in memory.  If Catena
&gt;&gt; tries to use too much memory, this memory might get swapped to
&gt;&gt; disk.  If Catena is running continuously, as it might on an
&gt;&gt; authentication server, with lambda == 3, there is about a 1 in 4
&gt;&gt; chance that a cold-boot attack, DMA attack, or forced
&gt;&gt; hibernation, will reveal H(H(key material)).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For Catena-BRG, this is indeed an attack which succeeds with a
&gt; chance of $1/(lambda+1)$. Thanks for pointing this out! We will
&gt; recommend to use Catena-BRG with MinGarlic = 1 in the next version
&gt; of our submission paper to thwart this attack.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That would slow you down 2X, meaning you would lose another 2X in 
&gt; memory*time defense against brute-force password guessing attacks.
&gt;  Instead, please consider doing what TwoCats does, and apply
&gt; Garlic starting at 0, but when you get close to the m_cost, just
&gt; skip ahead and to the last level of garlic.  This enables your
&gt; algorithm to trade-off defense against brute-force guessing attacks
&gt; vs memory-leak attacks.
&gt; 
&gt; I certainly have copied many good ideas from Catena.  It would be
&gt; nice to contribute back something :-)
&gt; 

We will indeed consider this idea! Thanks!

Best regards,
Jakob


&gt; 
&gt; When considering Catena-DBG (our new instance using a
&gt; double-butterfly graph), such an attack succeeds only with
&gt; probability of 1/((lambda*2(logn-2))+2logn-1), which leads to a
&gt; much stronger resistance in this case. Therefore, we plan to
&gt; recommend MinGarlic = 1 for Catena-BRG and MinGarlic=MaxGarlic for
&gt; Catena-DBG. What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'll read through it and get back to you.  Thanks for bringing
&gt; this issue up.  I do think it is one of the more important things
&gt; for defense.  OTOH, it does complicate algorithms...
&gt; 
&gt; Bill
