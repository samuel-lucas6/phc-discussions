Subject: Comments from Argon2 and Catena co-designers

Hi,

The PHC panel has been discussing which algorithms to includes in its final
portfolio (aka "winners"). Panel members believe that Argon2 and Catena are
the top candidates in the category where they're playing. It's difficult to
make up our mind though, so to help us we've asked designers of these
candidates to make the case for their respective candidates.

For a better transparency, we're publishing those comments below: comments
by Stefan Lucks from the Catena team (followed by his March 31 votes
regarding PHC winners), and comments by Dmitry Khovratovich from the Argon2
team. Both agreed to have their comments published here.

On Fri, 15 May 2015, Jean-Philippe Aumasson wrote:

&gt; Which instance(s) of Catena would you recommend?

Both. ;-) And let Catena-Axungia make the choice for you. (I am not sure
if "Axungia" is a good name, maybe we should rename it "Catena-Delphi".

One of the benefits of Catena (over Argon2i, for an instance) is that
Catena allows you to eat the cake, and keep it: Good defense for defenders
with moderate memory (say, 1 to 12 MB) and good defense for high-memory
defenders. Fixing "which instance" from the beginning would counter that
advantage.

&gt; IMHO a Dragonly instance is better suited, though I'm not sure that
&gt; there's a market for really high-memory hashes (say, 100MB+).

Same with me. Before PHC, I would never have anticipated people seriously
considering such large memory for password hashing (except, possibly, for
key derivation). I am not sure if the race to maximise the memory usage in
given time in the PHC competition is an offspring from some real demand
for that kind of password hashing, or an artifact of the competition.
Which is precisely why I think it would be good to maintain the best of
both worlds.

&gt; Also, what are the advantages of Catena(-Dragonfly) over Argon2i?

Well, Catena-Dragonfly and Argon2i are fairly similar. ;-) Catena has been
specifically designed as a framework, to support any hash function of your
choice. And it would be still Catena, as given in the specification
document, just another instantiation. E.g., one could easily employ Catena
based on SHA-512 (and its round function) to ease NIST standardisation.
Our specification actually invites such instantiations.

While you *can* rewrite Argon2 in a similar fashion, this would appear a
lot more intrusive. As I wrote before:

   Argon2 propes a compression function G, build upon the Blake2b round
   function. G compresses two 8192-bit values into a single 8192-bit value.
   The authors claim an improved performance for their compression function,
   compared to approaches using the Blake2b round function more directly.

   It is not clear under which circumstances one could change from the
   Blake2b round function to the round function of another primitive.

&gt;       3. As "honorable mentions" (or whatever phrase for the alternative
winners
&gt;       will be), I propose the winners in the A1 and A3 scenarios: Lyra2
and
&gt;       Makwa.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; These are probably the most thoughtful designs in their respective
categories. I believe
&gt; Makwa does deserve some kind of recognition, though I'm not sure that it
would gain traction
&gt; among developers. An argument is that Thomas is well-respected (esp. for
his Stackoverflow
&gt; contributions), which may help.

Agreed!

&gt; Do we need an A1 *and* and A2 winner though? (rhetorical)

It is a rethorical question -- but I'll answer it anyway.

Given the discussion on the benefits of a few more bits of pseudo-entropy
versus a weakness to side-channel attacks that could either kill you or
not affect you at all, I guess people would ask for it.

So long

1. Technical Criteria (I will not call this "superiority")
==========================================================

The PHC committee should select a portfolio of algorithms suitable for
different application scenarios. I anticipate three different
application scenarios:

A1, memory-hard password hashing, not much concern for side-channels:

Password hashing is performed in an environment, where one can neglect
side-channel attacks, such as cache-timings, this allows to maximise
the memory used (depending on the memory the defender can use for
password-hashing), and to provide maximum defense against slow-memory
attacks.

One might argue that scrypt, while not a candidate, also fits into
this scenario.

A2, memory-hard password hashing, avoid side-channels:

Password-hashing is performed in an environment, where one cannot
immediately exclude side-channel attacks. If one just tried to
maximise the memory used, one wold risk to loose everything by
side-channel attacks. The price for resistance to attacks such as
garbage-collector attacks and cache-timing attacks is that the
password hash function will be a bit slower, i.e., it will allocate
less memory than possible under A1. Also, the defense against
slow-memory attacks is reduced.

To the best of my knowledge, no pre-PHC password hashing functions
would fit into this scenario. Addressing this one of the main
innovations of the PHC competitions.

A3, password hashing with low memory:

This appears to be very similar to the established technique of
password hashing by iterating a cryptographic hash function many
times, as with, say, md5crypt. A password hash function for this
scenario faces the challenge of providing a significant benefit over
existing password hash functions.

Selection of Candidates:

The technical score I will give for each candidate is relative to the
application scenario. I refuse to call the candidates I vote for
"superior", compared to the candidates I downvote. My score and votes
are more about how well a candidate fits to its specific scenario.


2. Ease of Deployment
=====================

The two main questions are "how easy is the candidate to implement
from the scratch", and "given a reasonable implementation, how
difficult would it be to deploy it".


3. Features
===========

We are trying to select a new generation of password hashing
functions. Like a tuck takes to water, any modern hash function should
support features, such as client-independent updates and server
relief. Similarily, any password hashing function should be ready to
be used for key derivation.


4. Confidence and Trust
=======================

The winners should be based on well-understood cryptographic
primitives. As we have seen during the PHC competition, the
cryptographic community has not been very eager to analyse password
hashing functions in general, or the the PHC candidates specifically.
No PHC candidate designed as a primitive of its own right has already
been scrutinised sufficiently to be proposed for general usage.

Ideally, the winners should be based on a single primitive, and it
should be easy for the users to change to another primitive.
(Actually, this is related to Ease of Deployment.)


5. Specific Commeents on each of the Candidates:
================================================

Argon2:

I will not consider Argon(no-number) since it is in many ways inferior
to the revised version Argon2. The design strategy of Argon2 is
similar to the round2-tweaked submissions Lyra2 and Catena.

Argon2 comes in two variants, Argon2d, which targets for application
scenario A1 and Argon2i, which is a bit slower and targets for
application scenario A2.

Argon2 propes a compression function G, build upon the Blake2b round
function. G compresses two 8192-bit values into a single 8192-bit
value. The authors claim an improved performance for their compression
function, compared to approaches using the Blake2b round function more
directly.

It is not clear under which circumstances one could change from the
Blake2b round function to the round function of another primitive.

Given the novelity of G -- Argon2 has been propsed on January, 31st --
this approach would need much more scrutinity than it has seen so far.

battcrypt:

Battcrypt employs SHA-512 and Blowfish, two well-established
primitives. It targets for scenario A1. The submission document
provides a sketchy security analysis. It does not describe how to
apply client-independent updates, server relief, or key derivation.

While battcrypt is an interesting candidate, it is hard to see any
specific advantages or benefits over other candidates for the A1
scenario.

Catena:

By default, Catena employs Blake2b and the Blake2b round function.
Being a framework, it is easy to change to another hash function (say,
SHA-512) or another round function (say, the SHA-512 round function).
Catena targets for the A2 scenario and is supported by a significant
amount of security analysis. Its two main instantiations are
Catena-Butterfly for moderate memory usage, and Catena-Dragonfly for
large memory usage (under the constraints of the A2 scenario). It
readily supports client-independent updates, server relief, and key
derivation.

Lyra2:

Lyra2 targets for the A2 scenario. It employs a modified Blake2b round
function. The security implications of this are not quite clear. It
would appear straightforward, though to employ a different round
function, e.g., the original Blake2b round function or the SHA-512
round function.

Lyra2 is secure against garbage collector attacks. LYRA2 runs in two
phases. The first phase accesses the memory in a password-independent
manner, the second phase is password dependent. Thus, it provides
*some* resistance to cache-timing attacks, without victimising
resistance to low-memory attacks. This is in contrast to unlike
Argon2i and Catena, which provide full cache-timing resistance at the
cost of reduced resistance to low-memory attacks.

To be precise, Lyra2 is vulnerable to the following form of
cache-timing attacks: Given some cache-timings, the adversary is able
to crack low-entropy passwords, even without knowing the password
hash. Thus, if there is a chance to keep the password hashes secret,
or to encrypt them, and there is a chance that cache timings might
leak, then using a highly advanced password hash function, such as
Lyra2, may be worse than using md5crypt, or even storing the password
unencrypted.

Makwa:

Makwa targets for the A3 scenario. It is based on the unique (in the
PHC candidate field) idea of employing a primitive from asymmetric
cryptography, namely an operation similar to the RSA encryption. This
idea allows to support the unique "delegation" feature.

Parallel:

Parallelal employ SHA512 and also targets for the A3 scenario. Its
inner loop can be performed in parallel, i.e., not just the attacker
can benefit from parallelism, but also the defender. It is supported
by a brief security analysis.

At the first look, this is a cool idea. The chance to benefit from
parallelism may be a significant benefit for the defender, compared to
established password hashing functions, such as md5crypt. But by
"peppering", i.e., by keeping some bits of the salt secret,
parallelism is also applicable to established password hashing
functions. The benefit of the explicit parallelism in Parallel is
negligible.

POMELO

POMELO is another candidate for the A1 scenario. POMELO is not based
on an underlying primitive, but has been designed as a primitive of
its own right. For a newly designed primitive, the author's security
analysis is extremely short. POMELO provides the same limited
resistance to cache timing attacks, as Lyra2, risking to compromise
low-entropy passwords even when the password hash is kept secret or
encrypted.

The author discusses how to support client-independent updates with
POMELO. As pointet out by the author, this comes at the cost of
further weakening the resistance to cache-timing attacks. It is not
clear how to support server relief with POMELO. The submission
document does not discuss how to use POMELO for key derivation. But in
an email, the author claimed POMELO to be readily usable for key
derivation. The idea appears is to truncate the 256-byte output to the
number of bits required for the key. This approach would suffer from
two disadvantages, though: (1) Given the same salt and password,
shorter keys are just prefixes of longer keys. This may facilitate
attacks on schemes with flexible key sizes. (2) The keys cannot be
longer than 256 bit.

Pufferfish:

Like battcrypt, Pufferfish is based on SHA-512 and a modified
Blowfish. The security analysis is extremely short. The submission
document does not explain how to handle server relief,
client-independent updates or key derivation.

While Pufferfish is an interesting candidate, it is hard to see any
specific advantages or benefits over other candidates for the A1
scenario.

yescrypt:

Another candidate for the A1 scenario is yescrypt, based on the SALSA
round function and SHA-256. Both an advantage and a disadvantage is
the huge number of optional features and tunable parameters. One such
optional feature is, e.g., the novel idea of performing random (i.e.,
password-dependent) reads from a huge read-only memory. Activating
this feature does clearly kill resistance to cache timing attacks --
but it is optional, as so many other yescrypt features.

While yescrypt is an interesting candidate, the number of tunable
parameters and optional features appears to be a severe barrier to
deployment (at least for mere cryptographers, like myself). If
yescrypt is considered to be selected for PHC, a yescrypt-subset
should fix most of the tunable parameters and options.


6. Comparison of Candidates for A1 scenario:
============================================

There is a big field of good candidates in this field. I would vote
for Argon2d and Lyra2. If only one of them is to be promoted, I would
have a small preference for Lyra2.

A great candidate would be a well-chosen subset of yescrypt. But
yescrypt is too complex, and my understanding of all the features and
parameters is insufficient to propose an appropriate subset.

Scores:	       Technical	 Deployment 	Features  	 Confidence

Argon2d	       4		4		3		 2
battcrypt      1		5		0		 3
Lyra2	       5		4		3		 3
POMELO	       3		3		0		 1
Pufferfish     1		4		0		 3
yescrypt       4		0		1		 3


7. Comparison of Candidates for the A2 scenario:
================================================

Both Argon2i and Catena fit well to this scenario. A disadvantage of
Argon2i appears the novelity of the compression function G. It is
based on the Blake2b round function, but it has very low diffusion,
and would need further scrutinity. The effect of changing to the round
function from another primitive is unclear.

Otherwise, Argon2i is quite similar to the Dragonfly instance of
Catena. It lacks an instance similar to Catena-Butterfly, which
employs limited memory on the defender's side (say, 10MB or less), but
severely pushes back adversaries with less than that amount of memory.

Scores:	       Technical	 Deployment 	Features  	  Confidence

Argon2i	       3		 4		3		  2
Catena	       5		 4		3		  3


8. Comparison of Candidates for the A3 scenario:
================================================

Makwa is the only candidate that fits this scenario and does offer a
significant advantage over existing password hashing functions. The
somewhat low deployment score is due to the need for a big-num
library.

Scores:	       Technical	 Deployment 	Features	Confidence

Makwa		5		 3		3		3	
Parallel	0		 5		0		3


9. Final Remarks:
=================

The portability of the reference implementations (endianess problems)
is a non-issue for me. The PHC is about selecting password hashing
schemes. After that has been done, fixing the implementations is not a
big deal.

The above writing reflects my personal bias. I'd like to stress that I
didn't try to tweak the criteria such that the outcome for Catena is
good! The design choices we (the Catena team) made for Catena reflect
our (and, speficitcally, my) priorities, and the criteria I applied
for all PHC candidates are based on the same priorities, of course.

Hi Jean-Philippe,

Briefly speaking Catena-Dragonfly is still vulnerable to the same  tradeoff
attack that we showed last summer. Below we summarize several advantages of
Argon2i (default t_cost=3) over Catena-Dragonfly (default lambda=2):

 1) Argon2i is about three times as fast. On our 1.8 GHz machine it hashes
128 MB of RAM in 0.2 seconds, whereas Catena-Dragonfly spends 0.5 seconds
on the 2.5 GHz CPU (as reported). The independent benchmarks by Milan Broz
demonstrate a similar performance advantage by Argon2i.
Catena-Dragonfly-Full is 5-6 times as slow.

2) Argon2i supports multi-threading and can run twice as fast using
multiple threads, which Catena does not offer at least for the moment.

3) Argon2i is much more secure to tradeoff attacks. The computational
penalty using our best algorithms is 2^12 for using 1/2 of memory, 2^22 for
using 1/3 of memory and so on, whereas for Catena-Dragonfly these numbers
are 4 and 6 (linear function of the memory reduction factor). Even an
adversary with a number of parallel cores would spend much more area for
the cores than for the area already if the memory is reduced by the factor
of 3. Therefore, the time-area product for Argon2i can be reduced by 3 at
best, whereas for Catena-Dragonfly it can be reduced by the factor of 25.
The attack giving this reduction is a small modification of our first
attack on Catena, and we attach the description.

4) [our biased view] Argon2i is also simpler. The original Catena was very
simple, but the current version has too many parameters so that it is
difficult to understand how a concrete instance works.

5) Argon2i comes with a faster data-dependent version Argon2d essentially
for free (little change in specification and code).

6) Using two Blake2b rounds instead of one, Argon2i has twice larger
computing-time hardness for the same memory parameters as Catena-Dragonfly.

To be fair, we can list also the advantages of Catena as we see it:

1) Longer history and thus more third-party analysis.

2) Built-in support for standard cryptographic hash functions.
