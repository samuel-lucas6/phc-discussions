&gt; &gt; Adding both things to Argon2 would not be a problem. Actually, we
&gt; &gt; already considered replacing our Blake2b round with BlaMKa (or any
&gt; &gt; other modification that employs a low-latency high-throughput
&gt; &gt; instruction). The S-boxes we did not consider yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I now think it'd be best to use the same approach I had suggested and
&gt; Bill implemented for TwoCats.  Since you're already fully loading the
&gt; SIMD units with BLAKE2b rounds, use the scalar units for a single
&gt; pwxform lane chain.  This wouldn't really be pwxform - it would be
&gt; neither parallel, nor wide since it'd be locked to just one lane.  So no
&gt; tunable parallelism there.  But other than that, it'd be the same thing,
&gt; and by tuning the total number of rounds for this un-pwxform that you
&gt; perform per your 1 KB block, you'd achieve the equivalent of the desired
&gt; tunable latency and parallelism limitation.  All with just one parameter.
&gt; And no need to introduce data dependencies between your BLAKE2b rounds,
&gt; then.  So this replaces my two-bit tunable parallelism idea.

I've tried implementing and benchmarking this - please see the attached
patch.  For latency hardening equivalent to yescrypt current defaults -
so with 6 un-pwxform rounds per each of Argon2's BLAKE2b rounds (of
which it has 16 per 1 KB) - the performance impact on FX-8120 (whatever
I happened to test on) at 1 GB is only 15% for 1 thread, 5% for 8
threads.  In fact, even at double the latency hardening (12 un-pwxform
rounds per BLAKE2b round), the performance impact is 40% for 1 thread,
but only 10% for 8 threads (relative to original Argon2).  This is for
benchmarks inclusive of the memory allocation overhead, though.  The
impact would be relatively higher with overhead excluded.

I think these numbers are very good.  I recommend that this change be
completed (need to initialize the S-boxes properly, and decide on which
state[] elements and how are passed through this chain) and merged in
(also need to implement it into the non-SIMD version).

Not being a full pwxform - not parallel, nor wide - this does not
utilize wide S-box loads, nor SIMD multiplies.  So the total amount of
processing is less than yescrypt's.  But it should do the job of latency
hardening fine anyway.  The anti-GPU may be weaker than yescrypt's: the
S-box lookups are 4x less frequent and are 2x narrower each, although
this is partially mitigated (for local memory attacks, but not for
global memory attacks) by the parallelism also being 4x less.  This may
optionally be further mitigated by increasing the rounds count beyond
yescrypt's.

Maybe several round count settings should be supported: e.g., 1, 3, 6,
12 per BLAKE2b round.  Or maybe 0, 3, 6, 12 to allow for simpler
cut-down implementations (skipping S-box initialization) and for code
sharing with Argon2i.

I've also included some unrelated changes in this patch, which I needed
while testing.  Most notably, I fixed the previously broken --threads
option support (and the default of 4 threads, which didn't take effect).

&gt; Due to the S-boxes, this is only suitable for Argon2d.  You'll need to
&gt; use BlaMka or some S-box-less variation of un-pwxform for Argon2i.
&gt; In fact, you may also use BlaMka for Argon2d, along with un-pwxform, to
&gt; improve the tradeoff latency.

BTW, while at it, I suggest that these XORs:

                ref_block[i] = state[i] = _mm_xor_si128(state[i], ref_block[i]);

                state[i] = _mm_xor_si128(state[i], ref_block[i]); //Feedback

be replaced with 64-bit ADDs or SUBs, for a slight latency increase for
the attacker.  (I kept XORs in such places in yescrypt, but that's only
for consistency and potential code sharing with its legacy scrypt mode.)
