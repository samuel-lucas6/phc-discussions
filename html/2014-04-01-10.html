&gt;&gt; is it cool to make a hobby out of attacking all the submissions, even

&gt;
&gt; It is more than cool; it is highly recommended. The whole point of an
&gt; open cryptographic competition is to accumulate analysis, i.e. to have a
&gt; lot of people trying to break the algorithms. It is normal and expected
&gt; that submitters, in particular, will try real hard to break each other
&gt; algorithms.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If so, where is the place to discuss weaknesses of various hashing
&gt;&gt; algorithms?
&gt;
&gt; I'd say that discussions on password hashing algorithms are appropriate
&gt; on a mailing-list whose address is 'discussions&#64;...sword-hashing.net'.
&gt;
&gt; Usually, academics discuss cryptography by gathering regularly, and,
&gt; when they cannot meet physically, exchange written information over
&gt; appropriate mediums. Historically, papyrus and then parchment were used,
&gt; but nowadays emails are preferred. When someone has a full, elegant and
&gt; non-trivial attack to demonstrate, he usually writes it down with the
&gt; traditional formalism (i.e. an 'article') and pushes it through the
&gt; various mechanisms (conferences with proceedings, and/or the IACR ePrint
&gt; archive: <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/" rel="nofollow">http://eprint.iacr.org/</a> ); for smaller, faster remarks, and,
&gt; yes, discussions, this present mailing-list is expected to be used. In
&gt; particular during the first pruning phase, during which the list of
&gt; candidates should be reduced (24 are fine, but maybe a bit too much for
&gt; available cryptanalytic resources).
&gt;
&gt; At least that's how things worked for SHA-3. I don't remember if there
&gt; was a mailing-list for the AES competition.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I notice that poor AntCrypt is suffering from early cryptanalysis
&gt;
&gt; As far as can I see, it is more a specification/implementation issue,
&gt; but maybe I don't see everything that is to be seen. E.g. I don't follow
&gt; the IRC channel (maybe I should ?).
&gt;
&gt; For high-quality rational scientific debates, it is usually best if
&gt; people take time to structure their arguments and put them in due order;
&gt; so emails are a better format than chat-like interfaces. That's my
&gt; opinion.
&gt;

Thanks for that info.  So, we'll discuss here, and the fun continues :-)

I have some comments for AntCrypt, but if we all read it first that
would be pretty miserable for the author.  I'll read them all and post
a laundry-list.  Nothing major, just weaknesses not acknowledged by
the authors.  Some of the authors, like EARWORM, listed everything he
could think of, and I have nothing so far to add, but probably half of
the ones I've read so far didn't list any weaknesses at all, and so I
have a list...
