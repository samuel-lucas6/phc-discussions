&gt; &gt; Also, I've been seriously considering using 32-bit lanes.  (This has
&gt; &gt; some pros and cons.  Among the pros is better compatibility with Salsa20,
&gt; &gt; where it'd let us ignore SIMD shuffling of 32-bit words.  escrypt
&gt; &gt; currently has some extra complexity because of this shuffling, yet
&gt; &gt; having its new sub-block mixing work on 64-bit lanes.)  I think that
&gt; &gt; with careful design and with use of the variable S-boxes, 32-bit lanes
&gt; &gt; would be OK in terms of issues described above, but they'd provide a
&gt; &gt; smaller safety margin.  (Luckily, we're not talking cryptographic
&gt; &gt; security here, but just attacks that would allow for computation of the
&gt; &gt; hash with somewhat less resources than intended.)
&gt; 
&gt; A na?ve question perhaps, but would 64-bit lanes incur an [unnecessary?] performance penalty for defender's implementations on 32-bit processors like ARM?

N-bit lane width is not the same thing as friendliness to N-bit CPUs,
although it may be related.  With 64-bit lanes, it is easier to make
efficient use of 64-bit CPUs without SIMD (or when SIMD is not enabled
in a given build).  On a single-issue 32-bit CPU this could mean 2x more
parallelism than is necessary to fully use it, thereby making the hashes
weaker (since the attacker will make use of the parallelism cheaply and
without a corresponding increase in memory needs), but as long as we're
using the multi-cycle latency multiply instructions even those CPUs may
actually benefit from the parallelism.

Chances are that a CPU with a 32x32-&gt;64 multiply will also have ADDs
with carry-in and carry-out, so 64-bit addition is simply 2x more
instructions.  Yes, there's a data dependency preventing parallel
addition of low and high 32 bits, but any of these may execute in
parallel with some other nearby instruction (if the CPU has multi-issue
at all).  For example, if one 64-bit addition is followed by another
(computing a+b+c, where all 3 of these are 64-bit), the first 64-bit
addition's ADD-with-carry-in (ADC on x86) may execute in parallel with
the second 64-bit addition's ADD-with-carry-out (ADD on x86) since a+b's
low 32 bits are ready by then.

&gt; ...or could/should this be an adjustable parameter the site manager/sysadmin could set?

The number of lanes should be tunable, yes.  The lane width I think is
fine to fix at either 32 or 64 bits.

For truly weak CPUs (and this does not include modern ARM), the use of
integer multiplication is much more of an issue.  So maybe a cheaper
sub-block transformation should be defined for those.  Yet it may use
64-bit lanes too.  If desired, we can even reduce the parallelism within
64-bit lanes (in the multiply-less version of the sub-block
transformation) by intermixing low and high 32 bits within those lanes
in ways that are not parallelizable (unlike e.g. a sequence of 64-bit
ADDs is, to refer to the example above).  (And we'd expect that this
version of the sub-block transformation would typically only be enabled
when only one lane is in use.)

On 32-bit ARM, the current escrypt will use the UMLAL (scalar) or VMLAL
(vector) instruction:

<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0553a/BABIJGJB.html" rel="nofollow">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0553a/BABIJGJB.html</a>

"The UMLAL instruction interprets the values from Rn and Rm as unsigned
integers. It multiplies these integers, adds the 64-bit result to the
64-bit unsigned integer contained in RdHi and RdLo, and writes the
result back to RdHi and RdLo."

<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491c/BABDEAGJ.html" rel="nofollow">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491c/BABDEAGJ.html</a>

Vector multiply accumulate long: vmlal -&gt; Vr[i] := Va[i] + Vb[i] * Vc[i]

uint64x2_t vmlal_u32(uint64x2_t a, uint32x2_t b, uint32x2_t c); // VMLAL.U32 q0,d0,d0

This is actually better than x86(-64), where the addition has to be a
separate instruction.  The only integer SIMD multiply-add on x86(-64) is
32x32-&gt;32 + 32, available starting with SSE4.1, whereas x86(-64) has
lower latency 32x32-&gt;64 multiply across currently relevant CPUs, and it
is available starting with SSE2, so we use that - but it lacks fused ADD.

So 32-bit ARM is more 64-bit'ish than x86-64 in this respect, and the
current escrypt sub-block transformation actually favors ARM (slightly).
Maybe future x86 will gain 64-bit output integer multiply-add too.

We need to produce and benchmark implementations for ARM (both scalar
and vector), though.  So far, I only checked the instruction sets and
some published instruction timings.
