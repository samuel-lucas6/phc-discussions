Hi Hongjun,

&gt; Thank you for the analysis and comments!

Thank you for your prompt response!  One of the primary reasons why I
brought this to the discussions list was so that you could comment,
especially in case there was any misunderstanding on my part.

&gt; 1)  In your mail, "POMELO claims to be resistant to SIMD attacks. First, I
&gt; think we need to clarify: this may only apply if the hardware lacks
&gt; efficient gather"
&gt; 
&gt;       Be more accurate, POMELO is resistant to SIMD attacks if the hardware
&gt; lacks efficient gather and scatter.

You're correct.  That's another aspect where your read-writes (as opposed
to bcrypt's reads) may help.

&gt;       Fortunately (or unfortunately), currently there is no efficient
&gt; gather/scatter for random data accesses (according to what I know. Maybe I
&gt; am wrong here).   On the GPUs with dozens of parallel data processor, the
&gt; gather/scatter for random data access has very long latency.

Actually, on some recent GPUs that latency appears to be no higher than
it is for most other instructions (which is generally pretty high).
Specifically, from the speeds we're getting for bcrypt on HD 7970, it
appears that instruction latencies for this code are on the order of 10
cycles, which is not high for a GPU.  The limiting factor is the low
number of bcrypt instances that fit into local memory, preventing us
from hiding this latency (and in fact, from utilizing more than 1/4th of
the computing resources at all).

&gt; Even on the
&gt; latest Haswell CPU, it seems that the gather/scatter is implemented in
&gt; sequential rather than in parallel (taking around 10 cycles for gather the
&gt; data in L2 cache).

Yes, Haswell's SIMD gather loads are no faster than the corresponding
scalar code is.  (And IIRC there's no scatter in AVX2.  There is scatter
in the Larrabee, Xeon Phi, AVX-512 line.)

&gt; It is reasonable since parallel gather/scatter for
&gt; random data access requires much more extra circuits for accessing memory.

Of course.  Yet AMD GCN GPUs (and judging by bcrypt benchmarks, possibly
NVIDIA Maxwell as well) appear to implement gather/scatter surprisingly
well - better than Haswell and Knights Corner do.  On the slides
introducing GCN 3 years ago, it is said that each CU has 64 KB of "32
bank Shared Memory" supporting "Index Mode", servicing up to 32 x 32-bit
lanes per clock cycle with "direct decoupling return to VGPRs" and
"hardware conflict detection with auto scheduling" (this refers to bank
conflicts).  This is slide 21 in 2620_final.pdf (SHA-1
e84f120753dfcfe02f0008e19b7b2ce34d0c627b).  Then in
AMD_Southern_Islands_Instruction_Set_Architecture.pdf Revision 1.0 from
August 2012 (SHA-1 c64c24077eab93b070d291da3624a8d988d70d5d) Chapter 9,
Data Share Operations describes some of this in more detail, but
unfortunately appears a bit contradictory/ambiguous.  This chapter
starts with: "LDS permits high-speed write-to-read re-use of the memory
space (full gather/read/load and scatter/write/store operations)."
One additional detail is that each bank is two-port, allowing for 1 read
_and_ 1 write per clock cycle.  This is more ports per kilobyte (1 read
+ 1 write per 2 KB) than we see in modern CPUs for L1 cache (2 reads + 1
write per 32 KB).

Chapter 9 referenced above also mentions that "extended instructions,
read2/write2, can be 64-bits each", but it does not clarify whether or
not the effective number of LDS ports for these is halved (since each
64-bit access would access two banks' ports at once).  Probably it is,
which reduces the port count advantage over CPUs (where the few ports to
L1 cache are wide).

Another surprising detail of AMD GCN is that it has indexed access, and
even scatter/gather, also for VGPRs - and the total size of these is 4x
that of LDS (64 KB per SIMD unit, with 4 SIMD units per CU, as opposed
to just 64 KB of LDS per CU).  (Un)fortunately, a work-item can access
only at most 256 VGPRs, whether directly or by indices coming from
another VGPR, so at least under a typical programming model e.g.
bcrypt's S-boxes do not fit.  (As a test, we tried using this for one
half of one out of 4 S-boxes of bcrypt, and got only moderate slowdown
compared to an LDS-only implementation, due to the associated overhead
in "comparing" the index against 128 and choosing the right "code
path", which is actually done with either exec masks or bitmasks on the
data itself.)  So far, I was not able to find a conclusive answer as to
whether this limitation is bypassable by lower-level programming.  I was
able to find that it is at a level lower than OpenCL - page 165+ in
SI_3D_registers.pdf (SHA-1 6a2d869d49fddeba54349c497acf176204f32c22)
includes things such as "Number of VGPRs, granularity 4. Range is from
0-63 allocating 4, 8, 12, ... 256" - a certain 6-bit value at a certain
address (memory-mapped register?)  This might answer, negatively, the
question on whether we can go beyond 256 VGPRs for a single work-item.
But I am not certain.  While the 256 VGPRs limit is obvious from
instruction encodings for instruction forms that reference specific
VGPRs directly, there's nothing in the instruction encodings preventing
indexed access to higher-numbered VGPRs.  So maybe this is bypassable
e.g. with custom firmware and low-level APIs.  Anyway, this would be
just a nice extra - like I said, scatter/gather exists for LDS with no
such limitations, it's just that total LDS size is (un)fortunately more
limited than total VGPRs' size.

(The above might sounds like I'm into GPUs.  That's not the case.
I merely happened to look into these specific aspects.)

&gt; 2)  In your email, "I think POMELO partially fails at anti-SIMD, despite of
&gt; claims in its specification document.  It defeats SIMD for defense (if we
&gt; don't consider hashing multiple passwords within one instance, which is
&gt; cumbersome and is a risk), but not as much for attack. "
&gt; 
&gt;      You are right here.  This partial failure affects the security.  But I
&gt; think that the effect on security is also partial.  The random data
&gt; read/write in H remains the bottleneck, and it cannot be easily bypassed in
&gt; SIMD, especially on GPU.

I am not so sure.  For example, on Haswell we can pack four F's per SIMD
vector, then every four invocations of F we'll have to incur the
overhead of accessing the four instances' data-dependent S elements
sequentially (whether using Haswell's gather load instructions or not).
Despite of this overhead, we can still achieve most of SIMD's usual
speedup.  The overhead of accessing four elements sequentially may be
roughly the same as computing the 4-way SIMD F one more time, so the
total run time is only like 5/4th of what would be possible with fast,
hardware gather/scatter.

I think your "especially on GPU" happens to be true not because of
defeating SIMD on GPUs (which might not be the case, as I explained
above), but because of the limited local memory size on GPUs combined
with high instruction latencies typical for GPUs (not just for
gather/scatter).  The same would be true for a MIMD device with similar
local memory size, instruction latencies, and only a wide bus to global
memory (no way to access individual global memory banks).

&gt; 3)  I think that your tradeoff (one table lookup in every step) is
&gt; interesting.  That is my old design before optimization.  As you have
&gt; noticed, this tradeoff has some advantage, also some disadvantage.
&gt; 
&gt;      The rationale for the current POMELO version (one table lookup in 4
&gt; steps) is to achieve certain balance between table lookup and the
&gt; computation of F when the data is not in L3 cache (for the current desktop
&gt; CPUs).
&gt; 
&gt;       (The best optimization is to set different parameters for different
&gt; table sizes.  But the design would become too complicated,

Yes, this would certainly add complexity.

&gt; and inconvenient to the users.)

Why?  You can hide this detail within POMELO specification (and
implementations), although this means you'd have to hard-code the
relationship between m_cost and frequency of data-dependent lookups.

I think this might be the way to go.  In fact, you could even have
separate settings for G and H (where H would generally perform the
lookups more frequently), without adding to user inconvenience if you
hard-code both as step functions of m_cost.
