Subject: Re: [PHC] Any other authores ready for benchmarking? (was [PHC] Lyra2
 initial review)

Is better performance strictly better?   Is this meant to quantify
algorithm quality in some way or just to figure out which algorithms are in
the same equivalence class for performance?

Sorry if I'm asking a stupid question.   I'm definitely an outsider in this
community.

I'd say it probably doesn't make a lot of sense to benchmark PolyPassHash.
  Really the hashing algorithm used (and its performance) isn't the main
focus of the scheme.   It can be replaced with whatever algorithm one
prefers.   While it does not significantly change the performance of the
algorithm it uses, the focus of PolyPassHash is on increasing password
cracking time...

Thanks,
Justin

&gt; Yesterday, I had some fun benchmarking Lyra2, TwoCats, and Yescrypt.  Are
&gt; there any other authors who would like their algorithms benchmarked?  I'd
&gt; be happy to start tabulating data on all the entries that are ready for
&gt; benchmarking.  After yesterday's hack-fest, I don't feel simply running the
&gt; PHS routines without the involvement of the author is likely to generate
&gt; useful data, so I'm only going to do benchmarking the authors request for
&gt; now.
&gt;
&gt; We should discuss what to measure and how to report it.  Is there a better
&gt; place than posting it here?
&gt;
&gt; I think we maybe we need three memory size categories, where PHC entries
&gt; can be benchmarked in any or all of them.  Basically, the 3 memory sizes
&gt; correspond to:
&gt;
&gt; - L1 cache bound:  how about 8KiB?
&gt; - Cache bound: how about 8MiB?
&gt; - External DRAM bound: how about 2GiB?
&gt;
&gt; Also, some are not memory bound, for PBKDF2-like entries.  It's best if we
&gt; stick to powers of two for memory size, as some entries require that.
&gt;
&gt; The simplest thing to report is how long a algorithm takes to run to hash
&gt; for a given amount of memory, so I think we should report that.  However,
&gt; it needs to be interpreted based on what the algorithm is doing.  Assuming
&gt; the algorithm is linear in runtime for the range of memory in the category
&gt; (for example, heavily external DRAM bound), then we can can convert runtime
&gt; to now many MiB or GiB would be hashed in a 1 second runtime, by dividing
&gt; the memory hashed by the runtime.  This let's us compare the memory*time
&gt; cost for a 1 second runtime, and obviously higher is better.
&gt;
&gt; An important modification to the GiB/s hashed is the expected "average"
&gt; memory usage for a 1 second run.  Several entries call malloc or a similar
&gt; function to allocate uninitialized memory, and in a first loop they fill
&gt; that memory.  Linux does not allocate physical memory to malloc-ed address
&gt; space until it is accessed, so memory usage increases roughly linearly for
&gt; the first memory filling loop.  TwoCats fills memory and is done, so it's
&gt; average memory usage is only 1/2 of the total.  Others mostly write to
&gt; memory more than once, and so they reach peak memory early in the
&gt; algorithm.  For example Scrypt would be expected to have around a 75%
&gt; average memory usage relative to the total used, since it fills memory
&gt; linearly in the first loop and hashes it once in the second loop.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, there's memory bandwidth, which should be in terms of MiB or GiB
&gt; per second read/write to DRAM or cache.  Memory bandwidth is the primary
&gt; runtime defense for a lot of the entries, so having high bandwidth is very
&gt; important.  We can estimate memory bandwidth by the total memory hashed
&gt; divided by runtime, times the number of memory accesses on average.  Cache
&gt; adds a complication when estimating external DRAM bandwidth, but so far
&gt; we've been able to guestimate which reads are most likely cached, and
&gt; discount them for external DRAM bandwidth.  For example, for TwoCats, I
&gt; estimate each DRAM location is written on average once, and read on average
&gt; once, the same as Scrypt.
&gt;
&gt; Are these the right metrics?
