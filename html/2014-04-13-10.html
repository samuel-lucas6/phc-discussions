&gt; However, for this to be of help to PHC decision-making we need
&gt; attack-optimized implementations (in addition to defense-optimized

I was hoping that password crackers would jump at an opportunity to
optimize new algorithms, but maybe I'm being too optimistic :)


&gt; Chances are that almost all of the 23,
&gt; if wrapped into JtR formats, will (initially) be using mostly
&gt; defense-optimized code for attack, which is suboptimal and does not
&gt; (yet) significantly help us answer the questions we need answered.
&gt; It is nice extra testing anyway, though.

Well, I think it answers half the question. Knowing how the defense
optimized code performs is significant. And I think using JTR as a
testbed is a decent way to benchmark the defense optimized code, and
provides a good starting point for attackers to start optimizing code.


&gt; For Pufferfish and battcrypt, I think there may be significant speedup
&gt; from interleaving of multiple instances for attack.  Someone needs to
&gt; implement that.

Yeah, I was going to implement this in the attack-optimized JTR patch
for Pufferfish, but was short on time. I was able to kind of fake it
with MPI though by running 4 threads per core instead of 2 (CPU has HT),
I think this achieved a similar effect.


&gt; And indeed the memory (de)allocation overhead should be
&gt; out of loop for attack as well.  IIRC, you're using alloca() to avoid it
&gt; in the JtR patch, correct?

In the attack optimized code I am, yeah. I think this is one of the rare
instances where its use isn't totally inappropriate.


&gt; Also, we need GPU attack implementations.

Agreed, but there's a bit of a logistics problem with that, in that I
highly doubt we're going to be able to get 23 kernels written. Jens has
stated offlist that he plans to write kernels for his 6 favorite
algorithms, maybe we'll all get lucky and his 6 will align with the ones
we feel should be finalists.
