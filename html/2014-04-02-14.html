Subject: data-dependent branching (Re: [PHC] A little nit which bothers me...)

The Subject was among the worst one could have used, not carrying any
meaning.  I reluctantly chose to fix it.

Also, Brandon, I'm not sure if you're subscribed (you didn't post in
here until recently), hence the CC.  Let me know if you're in fact on
the list (I hope so!)

&gt; 
&gt; I never saw the point really.

I thought you advocated data-dependent branching or something like it
(switching between multiple crypto primitives) in your md5crypt EOL
announcement a couple of years ago.  I recall e-mailing you at the time,
expressing an opinion against data-dependent branching.  Well, that's
how it is in my memory.  It's good to know that your opinion is (now)
different (or I recall incorrectly). :-)

There is a point, and it is in causing attackers with massively parallel
hardware to waste some of their resources on some of:

1. Idle execution units (wasted die area, L1i cache or local memory).
If your hashing scheme may take one of many code paths on each
iteration, then an attack core implementing all of those code paths in
hardware will have all but one execution unit idle at each time.

2. Computation of never used intermediate results (multiple circuits
working in parallel followed by a MUX to choose the right result, or
eager execution on a GPU).

3. Buffering of intermediate results from multiple hash computations
(many more than there are parallel cores for), so that each individual
hash computation may temporarily stall, letting another proceed to a
next step instead.  That way, groups of operations matching each core's
actual circuits may be issued, not leaving any circuits idle most of the
time.  (I think this is roughly how the SunMD5 code in JtR -jumbo
manages to use SIMD, although I didn't review it very closely.  JimF
wrote it.  IIRC, its buffering is on the order of hundreds of candidate
passwords per CPU core, even though the target SIMD parallelism is an
order of magnitude lower.  The extra parallelism, which is easily
available to the attacker, is needed to ensure that the probability of
leaving idle resources (SIMD lanes in this case) is comfortably low.)

4. Routing of requests between attack cores, to pool the cores'
resources together.  In a sense, this moves the buffering to a higher
level: instead of each core maintaining a buffer sufficiently large to
keep its circuits busy most of the time, there's a shared (virtual)
buffer (comprised of each core's current outstanding requests to other
cores).  The required total buffer size is lower, but we get extra cost
of the routing.

A question is whether the lowest-cost (to the attacker) combination of
the above is still costly enough for the defender to bother going for
data-dependent branching.  In the case of SunMD5, we know that it is
not, at least not for attackers with SIMD CPUs.  This is in part because
in SunMD5 the amount of processing done per each data-dependent branch
is substantial, so the overhead of approach #3 above (and probably of #4)
is acceptably low.  This is why I especially oppose data-dependent
branching when we're talking e.g. about switching between different
crypto primitives, each consisting of multiple rounds and possibly with
a pipeline taking multiple cycles - this might be worth spending a
cycle(?) (only of latency?) e.g. on routing to a nearby core (and die
area on such routing).

AntCrypt tries to deal with #3 and #4 by making the bits of computation
performed per data-dependent branch very small(*), so the overhead would
be relatively much larger.  It tries to deal with #1 and #2 by having 16
possible functions, so the die area wastage from parallel circuits or
the wastage of a GPU's execution units or SIMD lanes from eager
execution would be 16x (arguably, this is still not good enough against
ASICs, where spending die area with memory may be more effective than
with computing cores even despite of the 16x wastage of the latter).

(*) They're like a handful of assembly instructions each... yet I think
the sin/cos/tan are not small enough (~100 cycles on modern CPUs), and
are very wasteful on a CPU, so they will need to be replaced for that
reason as well.

A simple if/else in a loop would be only 2x.  It'd take 4 nested levels
of if/else to reach 16x.  AntCrypt approaches this by having 16
alternatives at one level (in the code it's a switch statement, which is
presumably/hopefully compiled to a table lookup and one computed branch).
That's nice.  More than 16 would be nicer (but adds complexity and code
size for defenders).

The above were some comments on "why one might want to do data-dependent
branching", "how to do it if you're doing it anyway", and "how to attack
it".  My opinion remains that it's better to avoid it.  But it's not
totally unreasonable.  It's just risky, and tricky to do well (so that
it'd hurt attackers more than it hurts defenders).

&gt; First, the construct needs to be symmetic in order to not leak
&gt; too much timing information:
&gt; 
&gt; 	if (CONDITION(entropy)) {
&gt; 		entropy = FUNC1(entropy);
&gt; 		discard = FUNC2(entropy);
&gt; 	} else {
&gt; 		discard = FUNC1(entropy);
&gt; 		entropy = FUNC2(entropy);
&gt; 	}
&gt; 
&gt; But there are so much junk between the CPU and the memory these
&gt; days that I still expect timing attacks can demask the condition bit.

Yes, this is still risky.

&gt; The way to solve that is to only condition data-dependent
&gt; branching on "dead-end bits" which don't lead back to our entropy:
&gt; 
&gt; 	if (CONDITION(HASH(entropy || "Lorem ipsum dolor sit..."))) {
&gt; 		entropy = FUNC1(entropy);
&gt; 		discard = FUNC2(entropy);
&gt; 	} else {
&gt; 		discard = FUNC1(entropy);
&gt; 		entropy = FUNC2(entropy);
&gt; 	}

How does this not lead back to our entropy?  Do you assume the "Lorem
ipsum dolor sit..." is a secret key?  If so, we sort of already have
that, in the form of salts, if they're large and unpredictable enough
and don't leak until the hashes leak.  This is why we say that the
relevant attack scenario is when the attacker already has the salts and
(still) has online access to the system.

&gt; We cannot lower our standards and allow timing attacks against
&gt; "dead-end" bits:
&gt; 
&gt; 	if (CONDITION(HASH(entropy || "Lorem ipsum dolor sit..."))) {
&gt; 		entropy = FUNC1(entropy);
&gt; 	} else {
&gt; 		entropy = FUNC2(entropy);
&gt; 	}
&gt; 
&gt; That would give a 50% discount on a brute-force attack with timing
&gt; information.

I don't understand what you mean here.  If the "Lorem ..." is a secret
key, then either version of code is good.  If it is not, then either is bad.

&gt; In brute-force attack without timing information, the "discard"
&gt; bits could obviously be optimised out, that's also no good, so lets
&gt; not discard those bits anyway:
&gt; 
&gt; 	if (CONDITION(HASH(entropy || "Lorem ipsum dolor sit..."))) {
&gt; 		entropy[first_half] = FUNC1(entropy);
&gt; 		entropy[second_half] = FUNC2(entropy);
&gt; 	} else {
&gt; 		entropy[second_half] = FUNC1(entropy);
&gt; 		entropy[first_half] = FUNC2(entropy);
&gt; 	}
&gt; 
&gt; And then it follows trivially that this is the same as:
&gt; 
&gt; 	i = CONDITION(HASH(entropy || "Lorem ipsum dolor sit..."))
&gt; 	entropy = FUNC12(entropy);
&gt; 	if (i)
&gt; 		swap_first_and_second_half(entropy)
&gt; 
&gt; Ohh well...

Looks like you were going after a holy grail while writing that e-mail,
but didn't quite reach it. ;-)
