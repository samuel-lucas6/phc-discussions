Subject: Re: [PHC] Initial hashing function. Feedback welcome

Thanks for the excellent feedback!  I feel a lot better knowing you're
entering the competition.  I don't really have time or the background to
create a winning entry, but hopefully I can help try out some ideas.
 Comments below.

&gt; &gt; - On my Core i7 linux box, it's over 8X faster for a given memory size,
&gt; &gt; single-threaded, no SSE
&gt;
&gt; ... but don't we mostly care about the performance _with_ SSE (or
&gt; better), and depending on use case, also with concurrent use of all
&gt; cores (for computation of one or of many separate hashes, also depending
&gt; on use case and other factors)?
&gt;

I think it depends on whether or not I want to be able to do the KDF on
devices that don't have SSE or multiple cores.  I think filling the
available memory bandwidth should be goal #1, and to meet that goal on
mobile devices, we should have as simple a hashing function as possible.

I haven't added this to keystretch, but should we have another work
parameter for how hard to push the CPUs?

I liked your comment about running Salsa20/2, rather than Sala20/8.  Why
not make the /X a CPU work parameter?  I'm not sure that Sala20/20 is any
more secure than Salsa20/1 in memory hard KDFs, but being able to match the
CPU work to the use case would be cool.

Without a CPU work parameter, I would lean towards using the fastest
possible hashing algorithm with no SSE, since it needs to work on mobile
devices.

8x can easily be the difference between scrypt's -ref and -sse (once
&gt; it's optimized like I did), although perhaps not between -nosse and
&gt; -sse.  I guess your benchmark is for scrypt's -nosse.
&gt;

I just used the default build on Arch Linux for scrypt. The
files crypto_scrypt-nosse.c and crypto_scrypt-sse.c are identical, so I
guess the only difference is compiler flags.  I assume SSE is on by
default, but it doesn't look like there's been any hand optimization for
SSE, but I'm not sure.


&gt; In my testing (with optimized scrypt code using AVX or better) reducing
&gt; Salsa20 rounds count from 8 to 2 (4x reduction in round count) results
&gt; in less than 2x speedup, which suggests that replacing Salsa20/N with
&gt; something way simpler is not going to make all that much difference
&gt; either.  I guess you may be seeing much more of a difference in part
&gt; because you're only benchmarking a single thread.


True, but for low CPU power situations like a mobile phone, that's an
important case.  I would be interested in seeing both single and multiple
thread performance of Salsa20/N, and with/without SSE or better.


&gt; &gt; - Memory is hashed as it's filled, rather than filling, then hashing.
&gt;
&gt; This sounds similar to my changes to SMix first loop:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/crypt-dev/2013/11/25/3">http://www.openwall.com/lists/crypt-dev/2013/11/25/3</a>


Not coincidentally!

but extended to the second loop as well, replacing both of them with one
&gt; combined loop.  I thought of this too, but a drawback I saw was that
&gt; either I'd have to avoid random writes (which I had implemented as an
&gt; optional anti-TMTO feature) or I'd have to be computing two hashes (two
&gt; BlockMix'es in scrypt terms) per loop iteration (so that I write two
&gt; different values: one to the newly allocated V element and another to
&gt; the currently selected random element).  At that point, it is unclear if
&gt; there's any benefit from continuing to expand the size of V after
&gt; filling time/2 elements (if the price we pay is spending twice more time
&gt; per element filled).
&gt;
&gt; You might (or might not) have avoided this dilemma with careful design
&gt; of your RNG (or whatever you call it), having it produce two distinct
&gt; outputs in less than 2x time.
&gt;

My intent was to do random writes to L1 cache only, and only sequential
writes to external memory.  It seems to work in single-threaded mode, but
I'm having trouble with multiple thread mode.

One reason for keeping random writes in L1 cache, other than speed, is to
reduce information leakage about the key, just in case someone is able to
detect cache miss timing.

On my system, memcpy can copy 2GB in .29s.  That's 4GB of data r/w.
 Running keystretch on 2GB of memory does 2GB of random "page" reads, and
2GB of sequential writes in about .91s on a single thread.  After reading
your excellent links on cache timing, I suspect I could shave almost .3s
off the runtime with temporal writes, which memcpy probably already does.
 The other .3s seems like it will require better multithreading than what I
do now, and maybe better use of SSE.


&gt; Another drawback is the very low probability that the last few V
&gt; elements written will ever be accessed.


That worries me, too.  I like your described approach of having a sliding
window.  It's probably just better.  Would an attacker be able to free
memory that slides out of the window and reuse it?


&gt; &gt; - 2048 rounds of PBKDF2_SHA256 are used at the start to generate an
&gt; &gt; intermediate derived key.
&gt;
&gt; I dislike this.  It's very wasteful in use cases where our total running
&gt; time is very limited.  This may be all running time we can afford (if at
&gt; all), not leaving any time for the memory-hard portion.
&gt; &gt; - The derived key does not depend on the number of threads
&gt;

I may be having some basic disconnect here.  On my system, running
2,000,000 SHA-256 rounds using the code from scrypt takes 2.4s.  The worst
performing desktop based Javascript benchmark I've read is 50,000
rounds/second.  Even a low-end smartphone browser should be able to do 2048
rounds in a small fraction of a second.

Why do we care about the first few milliseconds?

I made the number initial SHA-256 rounds a parameter, but made the minimum
4096.  I'll set the default to 4096, and the minimum to 1024.  I can't see
a rationale for going lower.  The fact that both OpenSSL and TrueCrypt
hard-coded 2048 rounds with no options for better protection for my ssh
private key or TrueCrypt volume is the reason I got involved in this
password hashing in the first place.  We can buy BitCoin hardware that does
1G-hash of SHA-25s/second for $10.  2048 rounds doesn't even begin to slow
down an ASIC based password guesser.

Am I missing something here?  I suspect I've dropped a couple orders of
magnitude somewhere...

... as long as the number of threads is not greater than a pre-specified
&gt; maximum.  I can claim this too. ;-)  And scrypt can claim it too,
&gt; although with scrypt there's a reduction in area-time from increasing p,
&gt; so it better not be done unnecessarily.


Good point!  For some reason I though scrypt's result changed with p.

Looking at your code, you're resolving the higher area-time vs. number
&gt; of thread synchronizations tradeoff differently than I did, though.
&gt; I suggested having just one extra synchronization point (between the
&gt; equivalent of SMix's two loops), whereas in your case the
&gt; synchronization is continuous and the number of times a thread will have
&gt; to wait for other threads' data to become available is not pre-specified.


I'll have to rewrite that code anyway to keep the threads from writing to
the same physical pages of memory, as you suggested.  I'll probably wind up
using your scheme, more or less.


&gt; I see the advantage of being able to wipe the password early on, though,
&gt; and not fill lots of memory with data that is quickly derived from the
&gt; password (so, if leaked, may provide for quick password cracking too).
&gt;

I was shocked to see that the API we have to implement for the password
hashing competition passes the password as a "const void *" eliminating the
possibility of clearing the password.  I understand how people are freaked
out about side-channel timing attacks, but back in the 80's one way I used
to get coworker's passwords (because they dared me to and claimed I
couldn't) by forcing a binary dump on their FTP program that they left
running when they when to lunch.  You could literally run "strings" on the
binary and the password came right after the string "password".

Clearing the password shouldn't even be an option.  It should be mandatory.


&gt; Also, for password hashing bcrypt is a better baseline, and you don't
&gt; reach it - as it relates to attacks with GPUs - by 2048 iterations of
&gt; PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256.
&gt;

True, but we're following this with a memory-hard KDF.  I don't want to
spend as much time as bcrypt takes.  I just want to start with good
security and improve from there.


&gt; You appear to use random 64-bit lookups within a page, and that's quite
&gt; similar to how bcrypt happens to defeat GPUs now (with 32-bit lookups in
&gt; 4x1 KB S-boxes), so you might be lucky in that respect.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, the same property prevents a defensive implementation of
&gt; your hash from using SIMD (without 64-bit gather loads).


This is one reason someone with more experience at low-level parallelism
should write the winning entry.  With a good CPU workload parameter, it
makes sense to do as much SIMD as possible.  Without it, however, I'd
probably try to hash in a way that doesn't do well with SIMD.  So far, I've
been trying to do this.


&gt; &gt; Having the hash result not depend on the number of threads, and also
&gt; &gt; filling memory as we hash, allows me to have a stop pattern that I look
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; when decrypting.  Along with salt, I can store the final hash value,
&gt; which
&gt; &gt; also looks random.  When decrypting, I fill memory until this stop value
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; seen.  This allows better deniability for the encrypted file, as both the
&gt; &gt; hash and stop value appear to be random.  This is important for
&gt; TrueCrypt.
&gt;
&gt; Nice.  I think this has a drawback, though: a TrueCrypt cracker, if
&gt; aware of the settings that were used (or if can guess them fairly
&gt; reliably), will be able to reject wrong keys right after the KDF,
&gt; without proceeding with actual decryption of the user's data and
&gt; checking its checksum.


Good point.  I guess I prefer to know reliably whether I've typed the right
password after about a second, and I'd rather not wait for the file to fail
decrypting.  In any case, this is an option I'm planning for, but it need
not be used in most applications.


&gt; &gt; A weakness of the hashing function vs scrypt is that it is a simple
&gt; &gt; non-cryptographic hash, rather than script's Salsa20/8.  This is the
&gt; &gt; primary reason it runs faster.  If we do not need a strong cryptographic
&gt; &gt; hash, there is significant opportunity for improving performance.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any reason such a simple hash function should not be used?  I am
&gt; &gt; particularly interested in feedback on this point.
&gt;
&gt; This is a tough question.  I think the required properties of the hash
&gt; you use on every iteration depend on how your loops are structured.
&gt;

I would be interested in how fast Salsa20/1 runs.  If it is close to as
fast as what I'm doing, I'd say it would be better to let the user run
Salsa20/W, where W is a CPU work parameter he can select.

Thanks for the detailed review!  I know that took you some time, and likely
on your vacation.  I appreciate it.
