&gt; &gt; Without exposing too much of my intended design, I'd like to garner
&gt; &gt; some opinion if that is possible.
&gt;
&gt; you are not going to file a patent, are you?
&gt;

Auch, no.  Just wanting to test the water with one daft suggestion at a
time.



&gt;
&gt; &gt; So, lets say we can associate a given password with a scalar
&gt; &gt; password complexity measure in the interval [0,1] with an as yet to
&gt; &gt; be defined distribution.
&gt;
&gt; here is my objection, above the obvious leak issue. calculating
&gt; password strength is difficult. it will be a damn complex algorithm,
&gt; supported by tables, many equations and a sizeable dictionary.
&gt;

I suspect I may have a few ideas on how to do this efficiently, but I
haven't looked at the research yet to see what the state of play is and
what others may have done already.



&gt;
&gt; the complexity in itself is wrong. this strength estimator will dwarf
&gt; the actual hash in complexity. it is error prone and expensive. but
&gt; there are other problems as well.
&gt;

​Actually, that might not be the case.  I wouldn't have suggested this
design unless I thought it possible to create a complexity measure with a
simple algorithm (and no, I haven't got that far, was wanting to see
whether the main idea was workable first).




&gt;
&gt; do we standardize the definition and the data? in this case, smartcard
&gt; and such manufacturers will scratch their heads how to put all that
&gt; into their limited space.
&gt;

​Do we standardize parameters for other submissions?​




&gt;
&gt; or we allow different implementors to have different evaluation
&gt; algorithms. but this is wrong, because those algorithms must be
&gt; validated and reviewed. the very reason why we have standards is to
&gt; avoid all that hassle.
&gt;
&gt; different algorithms is also wrong because in case of password reuse,
&gt; if you measure different login times, you will acquire multiple
&gt; subsets, the intersection of which the password in question will
&gt; reside in.
&gt;
&gt;
​It can be standardised, although, yes, there are ancillary questions here.​




&gt; so i think this idea proves itself unfeasible for practicality
&gt; reasons.
&gt;
&gt;
​The objections you've highlighted here I had anticipated and *think* I
already have solutions for (the proof will be in the pudding though).  It
was more whether the side-channel was a deal-breaker for most people.
