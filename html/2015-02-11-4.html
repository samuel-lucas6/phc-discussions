Subject: Re: [PHC] PHC status report

Criteria such as elegance or simplicity are also important, and you're
right that these aren't measurable. Let me also refer to the SHA-3
competition, by quoting NIST's final announcement: "NIST chose KECCAK
over the four other excellent finalists for its elegant design, large
security margin, (...)"
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/sha-3_selection_announcement.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/sha-3_selection_announcement.pdf</a>.

Criteria in the call for submissions were not exhaustive, and it was
the job of submitters to optimize the engineering and presentation
quality of their submission.

I encourage you to look back at the AES candidates, and compare (say)
the elegance of AES vs. that of Mars :-)

&gt; I would like to add more comments on the following new criteria.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Elegance of design
&gt; 2. Originality and innovation
&gt;
&gt; Unlike the criteria in art or literature, the criteria of standards or
&gt; algorithms related to the security of system should be able to be measured
&gt; by scientific ways.
&gt;
&gt; Now, a question arises, "given an algorithm, how can we measure the elegance
&gt; of design and originality and innovation of the algorithm in scientific
&gt; ways?"
&gt;
&gt; As far as I know, there were (or are) no such criteria in cases of AES,
&gt; SHA-3, Caesar competitions, because such criteria are not scientifically
&gt; measurable! I believe that they can be only measurable by a biased
&gt; favoritism!
&gt;
&gt; In the link (<a href="https://password-hashing.net/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://password-hashing.net/index.html</a>), it is written, "To
&gt; identify new password hashing schemes suitable for widespread adoption, the
&gt; PHC follows the model of focused cryptographic competitions such as AES,
&gt; eSTREAM, or SHA-3 (see the Cryptographic competitions website)." However, I
&gt; wonder whether the PHC follows the model of focused cryptographic
&gt; competitions or not.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the beginning of the competition, the criteria were clearly mentioned
&gt;&gt; from the following link.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; <a href="https://password-hashing.net/call.html" rel="nofollow">https://password-hashing.net/call.html</a>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; However, as mentioned from another following link, when 9 candidates have
&gt;&gt; been recently selected, new criteria, which are totally unrelated to the
&gt;&gt; original ones, were added.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; <a href="https://password-hashing.net/report1.html" rel="nofollow">https://password-hashing.net/report1.html</a>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The two new criteria are added as follows:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Elegance of design
&gt;&gt; 2. Originality and innovation
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I wondered who added these new criteria, which were never mentioned
&gt;&gt; before, without the request of any permission of changing it internally and
&gt;&gt; publicly.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Due to the above new criteria, some of the candidates were not selected.
&gt;&gt; Directly speaking, the new criteria were secretly created, which is against
&gt;&gt; the rule of competition, to kick out those candidates, which is unfair and
&gt;&gt; even a crime.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Another main issue of the PHC is that 9 candidates were chosen without
&gt;&gt; providing comparison results with proper metrics, which are against all
&gt;&gt; other competitions such as AES, SHA-3, Caesar Competitons, etc. The
&gt;&gt; competition should be scientifically based on proper metrics with clear
&gt;&gt; comparison (not based on voting out of favoritism), according to the
&gt;&gt; criteria which were given in the beginning.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Since I was one of internal evaluators of SHA-3 candidates as a guest
&gt;&gt; researcher of NIST for three years, it more seems to me that the procedure
&gt;&gt; of the PHC looks immature to me. Even the PHC panel's recent selecting
&gt;&gt; procedure undermines the dignity of the PHC, the PHC panel, submitters, and
&gt;&gt; even crypto community. Please think it seriously.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope that the PHC panel might accept and correct their mistake and make
&gt;&gt; every effort to restore our dignity including everyone participating in the
&gt;&gt; PHC.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I think publishing the upvote and downvote counts
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; counts? why not the votes themselves? why is it a secret? normally
&gt;&gt;&gt; secret voting protects the voters from retaliation. i don't think it
&gt;&gt;&gt; applies to that case. on the contrary, keeping the vote secret (as
&gt;&gt;&gt; well as unexplained) casts the shadow of doubt on the rationality of
&gt;&gt;&gt; it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; we used the voting as a tool to focus
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; further discussion rather than to definitively choose the finalists.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; i was under the impression that the voting was the selection method.
&gt;&gt;&gt; if it wasn't, then it indeed does not matter much. what matters is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; actual rationale, what the selection was based on.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I guess you'd prefer some scoring system?  It wouldn't work.  Opinions
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; varied on what properties would be best to have vs. to avoid, so we
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; couldn't possibly have arrived at a common scoring system.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; the very reason to have a detailed rationale is that people don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt; to agree the result, they can rely on the facts. if the panel declares
&gt;&gt;&gt; a winner using one set of preferences, but that does not coincide my
&gt;&gt;&gt; own preferences, i can still use the results to find my own winner for
&gt;&gt;&gt; my own situation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this discussion should also be summarized, anonimized, and made
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; public.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; That's significant effort that's unlikely to address your concerns.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is the only task the panel had. you are talking about skipping
&gt;&gt;&gt; the only reason this competition exists. when you signed up to this,
&gt;&gt;&gt; what is it exactly that you offered to do? also, how is it that it
&gt;&gt;&gt; does not address my concerns? my concern is that the selection process
&gt;&gt;&gt; is not transparent, and basically no information is published.
&gt;&gt;&gt; publishing the actual decision process exactly solves that problem.
