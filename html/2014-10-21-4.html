&gt;&gt; - Drop support for ROM access frequency mask.  In practice, this 
&gt;&gt; will mean no ROM-on-SSD support (only ROM-in-RAM will be 
&gt;&gt; supported).  The reason why I am considering dropping this is 
&gt;&gt; that in most cases where I would have recommended use of 
&gt;&gt; ROM-on-SSD I would _also_ recommend simultaneous use of 
&gt;&gt; ROM-in-RAM, and then it would need to be two ROMs, with
&gt;&gt; different access frequency, resulting in even greater complexity.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps just one mask (only for the ROM-on-SSD) would be enough
&gt;&gt; even in that two-ROMs case, though.
&gt; 
&gt; My options are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Leave things as-is, meaning that "large" yescrypt users (on 
&gt; dedicated authentication servers) will have to choose either 
&gt; ROM-in-RAM or ROM-on-SSD, but not both at once (well, except 
&gt; possibly by chaining two invocations of yescrypt, which is a 
&gt; suboptimal hack).
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Add support for two ROMs at once.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Drop support for controlling ROM access frequency (and thus for
&gt;  ROM-on-SSD).
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, only #3 fits the topic of this posting, but I'd like 
&gt; this community's opinions on which option is best.  Technically, 
&gt; I'd be able to introduce #1 or #2 in a superset of yescrypt later 
&gt; even if I go with #3 now, so the question may be whether we want 
&gt; ROM-on-SSD considered a supported feature in PHC context (in the 
&gt; PHC candidate or in a currently existing superset of it).
&gt; 
&gt; For ROM-in-RAM, there's normally no reason to use a mask other
&gt; than 1, which means that 1/2 of reads (and obviously none of the
&gt; writes) are from ROM.

Hypothetically, I can imaging going to work for some huge
corporation... like Google for instance, maybe even in their
authentication group.  In that case, if I were going to internally
promote Yescrypt based password authentication servers, it might be
the case that many of my peers know even less about password hashing
than me.

I think my first challenge would be to convince people of the value of
ROM in the first place.  That's easy - it eliminates botnet attacks.
After that, explaining why we need *two* forms of ROM, and how that
makes password hashes more secure is actually beyond my skill level
right now.

Somehow I feel we need to be able to delegate a proper password hash
with the security of Makwa, while using a 1TiB ROM to defeat botnets,
and only store a user's public key in the user database.  I was told
about the idea of only storing user public keys rather than password
hashes recently, and I think the idea has merit.  However, that means
there is a private key sitting on an average user's cell phone, and
that key needs proper pin/password protection with a good password
hashing algorithm.  I certainly hope we can use a PHC winner for that :-)
