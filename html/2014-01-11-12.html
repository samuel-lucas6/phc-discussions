&gt; Actually, we had two Google Summer of Code projects last year,
&gt; implementing bcrypt and Litecoin (scrypt at 128 KB) on Epiphany.
&gt; We got reasonably good performance numbers for bcrypt.  For E64, they're
&gt; on par with common CPUs and GPUs, but at much lower energy consumption:

Sweet.

&gt;&gt; Grid based multi-CPU companies seem to come along
&gt;&gt; every few years.  I hope they do well, but the always seem to be a
&gt;&gt; solution looking for a problem.  Maybe they can sell a bunch to
&gt;&gt; governments for password cracking?
&gt;
&gt; Maybe, although I'd be happier with them satisfying commercial demand,
&gt; even if also for password cracking.  I think what's missing are PCIe
&gt; boards with multiple energy-efficient many-core chips per board.  Then
&gt; they'd be able to compete not only in terms of energy efficiency, but
&gt; also in terms of raw performance per board - for suitable tasks only,
&gt; though.  I did discuss this with Andreas, and he agrees.
&gt;
&gt; Another company - Kalray - recently released a PCIe board with their
&gt; 288-core chip, but it also has only one such chip, and it is pricey:

&gt; <a href="http://www.kalray.eu/technology/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kalray.eu/technology/</a>
&gt;
&gt; Regarding the 256 vs. 288 cores confusion, their replies on Twitter:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;@Kalray1&gt; @solardiz The MPPA256 has in reality 288 cores !  This brings 288*0.4*(1 branch + 2 ALU + 1 load/store + 1 FMA counted as 2) = 691.2 GOPS !
&gt; &lt;@Kalray1&gt; @solardiz  The MPPA256 has in reality 288 cores ! This brings  288*0.4*( 1 FMA counted as 2) = 230 GFLOPS !
&gt; &lt;@Kalray1&gt; @solardiz 16 clusters of 17 cores + 4 quad-cores in the IOs subsystems.
&gt;
&gt; Then there's Tilera, which I think is doing pretty well targeting the
&gt; high-speed networking market, providing solutions for traffic monitoring
&gt; and DPI (nasty!) and maybe also IDS/IPS and potentially anti-DDoS:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://tilera.com" rel="nofollow">http://tilera.com</a>
&gt;
&gt; And there's XMOS, but it's about realtime rather than high performance,
&gt; so sort of an alternative to small FPGAs (not good for password cracking):

&gt;
&gt; I guess you knew these, but I thought others on this mailing list might
&gt; appreciate a summary of current many-core/MIMD archs.

No, I hadn't heard of them.  Are they newish since the end of the
recession?  I've been buried in analog synthesis since then.  I try to
stay current with FPGA and structured ASIC technology.  The last new
startup I was involved with, other than my current company, Triad
Semiconductor, (who bought ViASIC), was Achronix, where I helped tune
their routing a bit.  I haven't seen a new FPGA or structured ASIC
company in a while.

Thanks for the links.  I'm still trying to get my head around
multi-processing in an XMOS microcontroller, but the others all seem
to be massively parallel computation engines.  Is there anything else
I should know about them?

Bill
