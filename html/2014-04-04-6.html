Subject: Re: EARWORM review

I got some sleep, and woke up with a crazy ASIC architecture to attack
EARWORM.  I think it would be pretty devastating, though AES seems to
be difficult to implement in FPGAs very well, so it's more of an AISC
thing.  However, it requires a copy of the ROM, which may be difficult
for an attacker to obtain.  This attack assumes the attacker has both
a copy of the ROM and many millions of password hashes he wishes to
brute-force guess.  This is not exactly a banana attack, IMO, but
requiring the ROM, password database, and a budget to build the ASIC
and this wild machine are going to limit this attack dramatically.

To attack EARWORM hashes which are run on a 1TiB ROM authentication
server, do the following:

- Break up the 1TiB ROM into 256 4GiB ROMs.
- Distribute these ROMs to 256 ASICs
- Also give each ASIC 4GiB of scratchpad memory
- Connect the ASICs in an 8-dimensional hypercube

The idea is that each ASIC is streaming in data from it's ROM over and
over, while computing workunits for many password guesses in parallel.
 As the 512-bit scratchpads for each password guess are updated with
their workunits, they are transmitted over the hypercube network to
the ASIC that owns the next needed workunit.

In this case, each ASIC would split up it's portion of the ROM into
4096 1MiB "chunk areas" in external DRAM.  It would also store up to
4GiB/64 = 64Mi password scratchpads, each representing a password
guess in progress.  As it loads it's 4096 chunk areas sequentially,
over and over, it computes all the workunit updates with as much
parallelism as the ASIC can support, maybe 100-ish or even 1000-ish
AESENC cores, pipelined maybe 6 deep.  That would be 600-ish to
6000-ish AESENC executed in parallel per ASIC, or around 150K to 1.5M
in total, applying AES-128 hashing to all of it's 512-bit scratchpads
that are waiting on that specific chunk area to be applied.

There would be thousands of such password scratchpads queued up for
each chuck area scratchpad memory.  The ASIC would most likely be
limited in how many AES-128 computations it could compute in parallel,
which is a very large number.  There would have to be some extra bytes
for each scratchpad indicating which password guess it belongs to, and
how many workunits have been applied.  Maybe it's expected final hash
should be included as well, so the ASICs could detect
correct/incorrect guesses.  Just details...

One reasonable defense against this attack would be to do memory-hard
writes as well as reads, to maybe a few MiB per password hash.  This
would cause my evil machine to need maybe 1000X more memory than I
described, memory bandwidth would likely become the bottleneck, and
the hypercube communication network might get overloaded.

What do you think?  I had fun dreaming this one up!  I hope it's not
too harsh... EARWORM looks like an easy finalist to me.
