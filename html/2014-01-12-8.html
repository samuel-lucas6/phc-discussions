&gt; Generally, people refer to me as a "router guy."  I've written a lot
&gt; of routers to connect stuff on chips.  One mistake I see over and over
&gt; when people come up with ideas for improving the speed of computation
&gt; is forgetting to take the routing penalties into account.  For
&gt; example, data flow machines would have dominated decades ago if not
&gt; for data routing delays.
&gt;
&gt; Our CPUs are stuck with tremendous routing delays that just don't
&gt; exist on an ASIC when computing our inner-loops.  Any attempt to
&gt; protect passwords with computation-limited inner loops is not going to
&gt; get us very far.
&gt;
&gt;
​This is probably a very daft question but what's "routing" in this
context? (my hardware knowledge is abysmal)​




&gt; If I really wanted to force an attacker to have a nice expensive CPU
&gt; like mine, I would fill instruction memory with pseudo-random
&gt; instructions.  Java is everywhere, so we could generate a megabyte of
&gt; bytecode in a way that we know it will execute a certain number of
&gt; hashing instructions before returning a hash result.  An attacker
&gt; would have to execute the code to make a password guess, and there's
&gt; no way he's going to execute that code faster than an Intel or AMD
&gt; CPU.  That would destroy his speed advantage, and we could still
&gt; hammer memory to reduce his cost advantage.  That would be awesome.
&gt;
&gt;
There have been a few discussions on this before, e.g. either using
bytecode/interpreted setup or abusing the peculiarities and compliexities
of the x86 instruction set (on Twitter irrc).

While I think it's potentially more promising that it first appears, there
are problems with portability and avoiding an attacker being able to reduce
the instructions to more simple logic operations, e.g. if an attacker knows
the generated instructions are taken from a small set, how easily can that
be mapped to simple logic operations.




&gt; However, that complicates the algorithm dramatically, hurts
&gt; portability, and brings all the security holes in Java to our password
&gt; KDF.  I think the security experts' heads would explode if we tried to
&gt; standardize such a KDF.
&gt;

​Definitely, but it doesn't necessarily need to be Java.  I'd even pondered
on whether it was possible to abuse Python... not that I'm a particular fan
of Python but it is at least fairly portable.​




&gt;
&gt; I think the next significant layer of protection after off-chip memory
&gt; should be using GPUs for KDF.  Most smart phones and likely all future
&gt; desktop and laptop CPUs have significant GPU hardware, and we could
&gt; use that in parallel with hashing external memory.  That's why I think
&gt; a KDF should be designed with an adjustable parallelism parameter.
&gt;

I agree - internal parallelism is good in my book: an attacker can always
gain advantages by guessing multiple passwords in parallel but a defender
can may only be able to use the parallelism within a single instance of the
algorithm.
