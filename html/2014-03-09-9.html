Subject: CFP: Passwords^14, Las Vegas, August 5-6

PasswordsCon will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, August 5th &amp; 6th, at
Tuscany Suites &amp; Casino, 255 East Flamingo Rd., Las Vegas.

Yes, we are teaming up with BsidesLV and co-locating with them. 2-for-1
conference action - all for the low, low price of FREE!

For the first time we'll expand into 2 tracks, offensive &amp; defensive.

We are looking for tools &amp; techniques on creating, retrieving, cracking,
storing, sending &amp; resetting passwords and PINs. Think you have *the*
replacement for passwords? Please, challenge us. We'd like to see common
japanese passphrases analyzed. Enterprise password management solutions.
Adaptive online rate-limiting algorithms for logins &amp; password resets.
Visual cryptography passwords. Grammar-based passphrase generators for
Russian, Swedish, Arabic and Yiddish. Keystroke dynamics, fingerprint
spoofing, you name it. Pretty much anything that has to do with
passwords &amp; PINs basically.

Previous speakers at PasswordsCon include:
Jens Steube (Hashcat), Joan Daemen (AES, SHA-3), Dmitry Sklyarov
(Elcomsoft), Andrey Belenko (viaForensics), Dmitry Sumin (Passware),
Jeremi Gosney, BitWeasil (Cryptohaze), James Nobis (freerainbowtables),
Colin Percival (scrypt, Tarsnap), Frank Stajano (Cambridge), Simon
Marechal (Openwall), Steve "Sc00bz" Thomas, Simon Josefsson (Yubico),
Marco Preuss (Kaspersky), Jeff Goldberg (AgileBits), Jean-Philippe
Aumasson (password-hashing.net), Howard Smith (Oracle) - and many others!

update topic &amp; contents along the way if needed. Not sure about your
