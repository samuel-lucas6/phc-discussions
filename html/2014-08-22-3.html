Hi Dmitry,

This is very nice analysis.  Thank you!

How would you summarize the reasons why Lyra2 T=1 appears to hold up
better than Catena-3 and -4 against computation in less memory?  Is it
primarily Lyra2 making more memory accesses per iteration (and thus more
of them total, at these settings, right?) or is Lyra2's simple reverse
order working better than Catena's bit reversal order, or both, or is
some other factor more important than these two?  (Yes, I didn't look
into your attacks closely.  Sorry.)

You appear to be focusing on relative slowdown at fractions of the full
memory usage, as well as on finding optimal tradeoff points in terms of
energy consumption per password tested.  While these results are highly
desirable to have, maybe even more important is cost per password tested
(e.g. also in terms of energy consumption) for the different PHC
candidates being compared when they're tuned for the same defensive
request rate capacity (on commodity server hardware)?  Indeed, you'd
need to estimate such costs at the candidates' respective optimal
tradeoff points.

Suppose you'd optimally attack Catena-3 at 1/32 memory, and Lyra2 and
Argon at full memory.  However, if Catena-3 at same defensive memory
cost setting is e.g. twice faster than Lyra2 and Argon (an arbitrary
number for the sake of illustrating my point), then this may enable a
defender to use roughly twice more memory with Catena-3 to achieve the
same (maximum affordable) time cost per hash computed.  Once Catena-3 is
tuned like that, its non-tradeoff area-time cost probably grows by a
factor of 4, meaning that it loses to Lyra2 and Argon only by a factor
of 8, not 32 as this could have originally appeared.  In some other
scenario (e.g. with other PHC candidates, or if the 2x speed difference
is actually an under-estimate), this might affect the rankings of PHC
candidates as it relates to practical relevance of their susceptibility
to TMTO.  Do you agree?

Isn't Argon significantly slower than both Catena-3 and Lyra2 T=1?
If so, it'd probably lose to Lyra2 when we consider actual attack costs
for same defense costs, rather than relative slowdowns with tradeoffs.
Is this your understanding too?

&gt; Additional comment: It is a standard practice in the crypto community to
&gt; give explicit security claims for the recommended parameter sets so that
&gt; cryptanalysts could easily identify the primary targets. Many PHC
&gt; candidates do not follow this rule by not only missing these claims but
&gt; also concealing the recommended parameters. As a result, cryptanalysts like
&gt; me spend valuable time attacking wrong sets or spreading the attention over
&gt; multiple targets.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember: third-party cryptanalysis increases the confidence in your
&gt; design, not decreases it (unless it is badly broken). Analysis of a 5%-part
&gt; of your submission (one of 20 possible parameter sets) is little better
&gt; than no analysis at all. It is also worth mentioning that to make fair
&gt; comparison of candidates, benchmarks and performance discussion in general
&gt; should cover recommended parameter sets only.

I agree.  yescrypt tries to achieve adequate security for whatever time
and memory costs are given to it, across a very wide range of possible
settings (ranging from kilobytes for RAM, to terabytes for RAM+ROM).
However, I think we want to focus on the following parameter sets when
evaluating yescrypt vs. other candidates:

Common defaults for all tests:
p=1 (no internal thread-level parallelism)
t=0 (lowest running time for a given memory usage)
mask=1 (every other read is from ROM, if available)
YESCRYPT_RW and YESCRYPT_PWXFORM flags are set
YESCRYPT_PARALLEL_SMIX flag does not matter (is no-op when p=1)

RAM only tests:

1. r=8 N=2048
(2 MiB, request rate ~10k/s on a 16-core server)

2. r=8 N=16384
(16 MiB, request rate ~1k/s on a 16-core server)

3. r=8 N=1048576
(1 GiB, KDF use)

4. r=8 N=1048576 p=(a multiple of logical CPU count) YESCRYPT_PARALLEL_SMIX set
(1 GiB, KDF use, multi-threaded)

RAM+ROM tests:

5. r=7 N=2048 NROM=134217728
(1.75 MiB RAM, 112 GiB ROM, request rate ~10k/s on a 16-core server)

6. r=7 N=16384 NROM=134217728
(14 MiB RAM, 112 GiB ROM, request rate ~1k/s on a 16-core server)

You may adjust NROM to fit your hardware, and/or we may provide access
to our machine.  At least for the tests with ROM, the system should have
enough "huge pages" allocated and available to the user account, as
shown here:
<a href="http://www.openwall.com/presentations/PHDays2014-Yescrypt/mgp00014.html">http://www.openwall.com/presentations/PHDays2014-Yescrypt/mgp00014.html</a>

Please note that yescrypt's TMTO resistance grows with higher t.  At t=0
it is meant to be adequate, but not excessive.  Optimal t doesn't
necessarily correspond to "full memory" being the optimal attack point.
I think our actual goal should be different, as I tried to explain above -
namely, maximizing attack costs in absolute terms, for same defense
costs.  And t is part of the defense costs, so it should be kept as low
as practical.

If you analyze yescrypt and conclude that optimal attack/defense cost
ratio is achieved at some t &gt; 0, then this may be a reason to recommend
such higher t for yescrypt going forward.  For now, I'd like to give t=0
a try.

Thanks again,

Alexander
