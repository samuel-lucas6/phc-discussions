&gt; 
&gt; If so, why not for lower sizes as well?  Do you mention this as
&gt; the lower boundary just in case, since Pufferfish (and bcrypt, but
&gt; it's not in PHC) might win at some really low sizes (perhaps way
&gt; below 1 MiB)?

Yescrypt likely provides the strongest ASIC defense for all hashing
sizes, but it is a lot harder to analyze.  With more of the CPU cores
tied up when maxing out L3 bandwidth, Yescrypt will require more chip
resources and power to attack than TwoCats, though I think TwoCats is
quite good for cache-bound defense.

I didn't want to claim Yescrypt has the best ASIC resistance at small
memory sizes when I haven't carefully analyzed all the entries that
don't easily bust out of cache.  I've been a lot less interested in
algorithms that don't deal with DRAM latency issues, so I can't claim
to know enough about them to rate their ASIC resistance for small
memory sizes.  I'll get there eventually :-)

&gt;&gt; Lyra2 is a close second, off by about 2X in my tests, only
&gt;&gt; because Lyra2 does not have a multi-threading option.
&gt; 
&gt; Only 2x worse while completely lacking computation latency
&gt; hardening? Are you sure it's safe to rely solely on memory latency
&gt; and bandwidth? Previously, you were not so sure.

No, it's not enough for the truly paranoid.  I still recommend that
Lyra2 add some additional compute-time hardening, but that would make
it more complex, and that is a trade-off that could reasonably go the
other way.

I've mentioned this idea before, but integrating the hashing cores
onto a Samsung 4Gib DRAM chip could be devastating to hashing
algorithms that depend only on DRAM bandwidth for hardness.  The
bandwidth possible on-chip is insane.  Instead of 32-bit buses, we
could have 1024-bit buses, and latency would go down rather than up,
because we'd eliminate a lot of the muxing-down from the DRAM blocks
and be closer to their native width.  The flexibility to hash with
multiple cores on small portions of the DRAM chip or having one use
the full 512MiB would not be hard, so it could do 16 32MiB hashes in
parallel, or one 512MiB hash, for example.

A problem here for attacking Yescrypt and TwoCats is that DRAMs are
memory optimized rather than logic optimized.  Lyra2 and a lot of
other entries can be sped up quite a bit in custom logic.  I think it
would only take a clock cycle to compute a Blake2b round, even on a
slow 1.5GHz DRAM process.  Loading a cache with one row of Lyra2 data
could be done at speeds I don't even want to think about, so the only
limitation would be the read/write latency to a 1-row cache, and it's
a memory optimized process!

In comparison, both TwoCats and Yescrypt have multiplication chains
that would give the DRAM process fits.  They'd be lucky to do them in
3 clocks at 1.5GHz, twice as slow as an Intel CPU.  However, they
could still execute 16 32MiB hashes in parallel, just not quite as
fast as cache latency limited hashes like Lyra2.  Lyra2's sequential
computation chain and unpredictable addressing make it impossible to
do more than one Blake2 + a couple reads and write to local cache per
clock, and there might have to be an extra clock for unpredictable
read latency, so it's not too bad.

&gt;&gt; Here's two sets of cache tests.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!  Per these results, for 4096 byte blocks all 3 levels of
&gt; cache are equally fast, and RAM is less than 2x slower.  This may
&gt; be so for 1 thread on an otherwise idle system, but it is important
&gt; to remember that with multiple running threads things may be very
&gt; different: the caches closer to the CPU cores may demonstrate much
&gt; better scalability than others (and than RAM) since they and/or the
&gt; buses to them are more numerous.

Good point!  I'll have to add multiple threads to my test.

&gt; (With multi-threaded hashing, with some working set sizes close to
&gt; the total L3 cache size, L3 turns out to be moderately slower than
&gt; RAM. This is despite of L3 being several times faster than RAM for
&gt; purely sequential reads, as opposed to for reads in large random
&gt; blocks, also from multiple threads on the same system.  Luckily,
&gt; this phenomenon, or rather it occurring to a sufficient extent that
&gt; L3 appears slower than RAM, is not very common.)
&gt; 
&gt; Alexander

I'll see if I can reproduce this case.
