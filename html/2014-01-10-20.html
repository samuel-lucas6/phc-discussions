[ 1GB vs 10 MB ]

&gt; That's why Catena's Sever Relief idea makes sense.  The key stretching
&gt; should be matched to the machine it's running on.  For my laptop, I
&gt; would prefer 2GB.  For my phone, maybe 256MB.  On a loaded server, maybe
&gt; 10MB is all it can afford.
&gt; 
&gt;     We designed Catena to run smoothly on (almost) any modern computer
&gt;     without causing extra pain for regular users/admins.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That's awesome, but I think we should not develop for the lowest common
&gt; denominator machine.  Scrypt measures the available RAM and CPU speed
&gt; and picks parameters automatically.  For client-side KDF, I think this
&gt; is a good way to go.

Yes. there is a significant amount of hosts were this approach works ver
well. You are free to adjust Catena-n cost parameters as well.


&gt; For KDF that runs on my machine, I want a good fraction of a second of
&gt; KDF with maximum memory usage.  I think server admins will appreciate a
&gt; password protection framework that's easy to use, flexible, and stays
&gt; out of their way if needed.  I think the Catena framework sounds like
&gt; the right approach.  My only  gripe is that if I'm going to spend 1
&gt; second on a KDF, I'm going to want to hash a lot of memory.  Script's
&gt; speed (about 1/4 GB/second on my development machine) should be
&gt; considered the lower bound on acceptable efficiency, IMO.

"Of course it is not secure, but look how fast it is!" :-)


&gt; There is no reason Catena has to run slowly, and I haven't looked at the
&gt; code, so I don't know what efficiency changes have been made.  For
&gt; example, you could run with two rows small enough to fit in L1 cache,
&gt; and then do a ton of rows, followed by a final round that hashes all
&gt; memory from all rows 4KB at a time.

Nope. We are not interested that Catena can not efficiently computed
without tones of  L1 and L2 cache misses since this also effects
the performance of GPU implementations.


&gt; You could replace memory locations in Catena's rows with blocks of
&gt; memory of significant size, and have randomized edges between blocks
&gt; instead of a single edge between nodes.

Hmm...

&gt;  You also could also use an ultra-fast non-cryptographic hash in the
&gt; inner loop.

Maybe we can reduce the demands on the inner-loop hash function without
getting into (theoretical) trouble.


&gt;  You also could modify the graph a bit so that the inner
&gt; loop could process a user-selectable number of hashes in parallel. 

&gt; That alone makes a 3X speed difference on my development machine.  Adding
&gt; multiple threads is as simple as running N copies at the same time, and
&gt; you could hash memory between them as a post-process to force cheaters
&gt; to keep it all.

You have some nice ideas which will be discussed in the near future. I
will keep you up-to-date.


Best regards,
Christian
