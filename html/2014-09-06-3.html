Subject: A review per day - Lyra2

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Summary
- --------

I'm taking this review as my chance to compare the three best Scrypt
replacement algorithms.  See the attached spreadsheet for a quick
summary of this comparison.  I give a 100 to the best algorithm in
each category, and try to rate the merit on a scale from 0 to 100 on
the rest.  Some other candidates would achieve a higher rating than
these algorithms in some categories.  A lot of this is a matter of
opinion, especially the relative scores which are in fuzzy units.

Lyra2 is one of three serious entries that succeeds at improving over
Scrypt.  There are some other entries that try, but fall short when
hashing 1GiB rather than 1MiB.  A couple do a great job, such as
EARWORM, but are not general purpose like Scrypt.

The three serious potential Scrypt upgrades are Lyra2, TwoCats (my
entry), and Yescrypt. IMO, any presentation contrasting the PHC
entries that does not include at least one of these algorithms in
their "winners" picks shows that the presenter does not understand the
relative merits of the entries.

While Lyra2 is an excellent entry, and a worthy upgrade to Scrypt, I
prefer TwoCats over Lyra2, and Yescrypt over TwoCats.  I'll spend most
of this long review contrasting these three algorithms.  It is not
possible for me to do this in an unbiased way, and I apologize to the
Lyra2 authors for this.  Please do chime in and correct me, and add
additional comparison criteria.

Basically, to be a decent upgrade to Scrypt, you need:

- - A GPU defense strategy
- - An ASIC defense strategy
- - A fast hashing algorithm for filling memory - NOT a full
cryptographic hash
- - A method for lowering DRAM cache-miss penalties
- - A Time-Memory Trade-off (TMTO) defense strategy
- - Multi-threading support with data exchanges between threads
- - Carefully tuned hashing optimized for SIMD
- - Low dependence on special hardware

Comparison
- ----------

Yescrypt wins at GPU defense, due to it's rapid unpredictable small
memory reads from L1 cache.  Like bcrypt, Yescrypt issues multiple
unpredictable small memory reads in parallel, to get to about 1/2 the
number that bcrypt does when single-threaded.  TwoCats only issues one
unpredictable read at a time, and performs them at about 1/3 the
number as bcrypt when single threaded.  However, Yescrypt is designed
to max out everything at the same time, including CPU cores, while
TwoCats runs into memory bottlenecks on my test machine using only
half the CPU cores.  This gives Yescrypt a 3X-ish advantage over
TwoCats in unpredictable read rate, which likely translates into
better GPU defense.  Lyra2 does small-ish unpredictable reads, but
only once per Blake2b reduced round, which is several clock cycles,
and several times slower than either Yescrypt or TwoCats.  This
translates into weaker GPU defense, though I am not qualified to say
by how much.

ASIC defense for large memory hashing is excellent for all three,
assuming Lyra2 becomes multi-threaded.  An ASIC attacker will quickly
become memory bandwidth limited.  Practical ASIC attacks have at most
about a 32 times higher memory bandwidth than a modern high-end CPU.
This enables an attacker to run up to 32 times faster, but the expense
per ASIC of such a system is likely similar to the cost of a desktop
PC.  TwoCats and Yescrypt have multiplication chain compute-time
hardening, which in some cases will limit an attacker's ability to
hash at the full speed supported by his memory bandwidth.  In that
case, Yescrypt and TwoCats will force an attacker to either make fewer
guesses per second, or buy more memory so that more attacks can be
interleaved, filling up memory bandwidth.  Yescrypt and TwoCats win
over Lyra2 because of this.  TwoCat's multiplication chains are
tunable, allowing it to tune the multiplication chain lengths to the
hashing speed of the machine.  This allows TwoCats to be more
multiplication chain hardened than Yescrypt in some cases.  The extra
area on the ASIC needed by Lyra2 and Yescrypt computation logic vs
TwoCats is tiny, as there would only be 32 copies at most.  TwoCats
has a slight win here over Yescrypt.

Against 1-8MiB on-chip memory hashing ASIC attacks, Yescrypt and Lyra2
make increased use of the SIMD unit which will cause the AISC to be
slightly bigger than when attacking TwoCats.  All three algorithms
will max out the large memory access speed, but Yescrypt does two
unpredictable reads in parallel, which should slow down the ASIC
memory slightly.  On the other hand, multiplication chains might into
play here.  The ASIC memory can be optimized for the algorithm in use,
allowing much lower average latencies, and the right number of
read/write ports.  Only the multiplication chains will keep an
attacker from making full use of his improved memory speed.  I think
Yescrypt and TwoCats tie here because TwoCat's better multiplication
hardening and Yescrypt's slightly larger area may cause roughly equal
grief to the attack.

TwoCats and Yescrypt fair better than Lyra2 against and ASIC attack
when hashing only 8KiB of memory.  With multiplication chains, an ASIC
attack might still speed up TwoCats by 2X, and Yescrypt maybe 3X (a
bit of a WAG here).  However the Blake2b hash was practically designed
for an ASIC attack, and will run many times faster.  The lack of
compute time hardening in Lyra2 will allow maybe a 10X speed increase
for the attacker.  The area of the multipliers in TwoCats and Yescrypt
also become a factor, being around the same size as the memory in
Yescrypt's case, and about half that in TwoCat's case.  Because of the
extra area required for Yescrypt hashing, I cannot predict which has
the better ASIC defense.  I would call it a tie again between Yescrypt
and TwoCats, with Lyra2 trailing by some distance.

It may be common for some groups of users to run single-threaded,
though I recommend against it in all cases except for single-core
CPUs.  In that case, TwoCats wins in ASIC defense simply because it
will fill more memory than either Lyra2 or Yescrypt.  A single TwoCats
thread fills external memory over twice the speed of either Yescrypt
or Lyra2.  When no SIMD unit is available, that ratio might increases
by a factor of about 4, corresponding to the pipeline depth used in
the SIMD units by Yescrypt and Lyra2.

By the way, TwoCats and Yescrypt also beat bcrypt in tiny memory ASIC
attacks.  Bcrypt may make 4 parallel unpredictable reads per cycle,
but it does so to 4 separate super-tiny SRAMs, making them even
faster, and it has zero compute-time hardening.

For defense against cache-timing attacks, TwoCats wins.  A
cache-timing upgrade is planned for Yescrypt, and Yescrypt may come
out on top when this happens, but without an algorithm to test, it is
impossible to say.  Lyra2 has a cache-timing resistant first loop,
like TwoCats, but it uses a weak memory access pattern that leaves it
vulnerable to a very high TMTO attack when cache-timing data is
available.  Lyra2, IMO, should be upgraded to use something like the
Gambit memory access pattern, which defended against my auto-pebbler
attack far better.

One of the most important applications for a password hashing
algorithm of the strength that can be provided by these algorithms is
user authentication on dedicated authentication servers.  Yescrypt
clearly wins in this category, and in fact the algorithm seems to have
been designed with this application as the primary target.  The extra
security provided to small memory hashes of a few MiB with large ROM
hashing puts it in a class only shared by EARWORM.  EARWORM was my
other favorite for this category until I realized it has a weakness
against distributed ROM attacks due to it's very low RAM usage.  As
things stand, Yescrypt is easily the best algorithm for authentication
servers in the competition.  It's weaknesses, such as not yet having
any cache-timing defense, don't matter much in this application, and
it's strengths really come to bear.  Yescrypt will keep 8 CPUs very
busy in parallel while hammering memory at insane speeds, providing
thousands of authentications per second, strengthened by ROM hashing
in addition to megabytes of memory.  Even if the password database AND
ROM leak to an attacker, a botnet will not be able to work on password
cracking if the ROM is large enough.  There are many features besides
this in Yescrypt for authentication servers.  In comparison, both
TwoCats and Lyra2 opted for a bit more simplicity, and provide no
authentication server specific features, such as ROM support.

While all three have no requirement for special hardware, all three
are tuned for modern x86 SIMD units.  TwoCats I think wins in
adaptability to basic CPUs.  This is because it can run with a single
32-bit width with far fewer instructions per byte of memory hashed.
Yescrypt also has variable width SIMD loops, but it's pipeline depth
is not currently variable, making it slow down somewhat on a basic
CPU.  TwoCats wins here because it uses less pipelined parallelism.
This is basically a duplicate of the single-threaded comments above :-)

All three algorithms have variable hashing block sizes, enabling them
to tune to a machine's DRAM cache miss penalty.  The longer the
penalty, the more memory you want to read in one shot.  All three tie
on this point, but win vs most of the other entries.  Every entry
without a capability to read large blocks of memory at a time cannot
supplant Scrypt.

Lyra2 easily wins at TMTO defense.  Both Lyra2 and Yescrypt use
increasing t_cost to improve TMTO defense, but Lyra2's decision to
continue overwriting memory while reading I think makes it more TMTO
resistant.  TwoCats as submitted uses t_cost poorly.  A revised
version exists that will be submitted if allowed, which does increase
TMTO resistance as t_cost increases, but this feature works better in
Lyra2 and Yescrypt.  However, because TwoCats was designed as a single
pass algorithm, it has the best TMTO resistance when t_cost turned
off, meaning only one memory pass.  This is not a mode Lyra2 allows,
but Yescrypt does, and both Yescrypt and TwoCats achieve higher
memory*time defense as a result.

All three have a TMTO defense that improves over Scrypt, but Lyra2
sacrifices speed and thus time*memory defense in order to improve it's
TMTO defense.  This lower time*memory defense may be the main reason I
prefer TwoCats and Yescrypt.  TMTO attacks gain little against TwoCats
in any configuration (maybe 10-15% time*memory benefit), and even less
against Yescryt and Lyra2.  This is why I feel TMTO defense is not a
very important factor when comparing these three algorithms.  If TMTO
defense were paramount, I would choose Lyra2 as my favorite.  As it
is, TMTO defense is good enough in all three.  A final note about
TMTO: Yescryt and TwoCats both have techniques for mixing data between
threads, making it difficult to benefit from running each thread
sequentially.

As for time*memory defense, Yescrypt, when run with t_cost == 0, has
the same characteristics as TwoCats, filling memory linearly, never
stopping until enough memory has been hashed.  This maximizes
time*memory defense vs any other possible solution.  Lyra2 does at
least two passes over memory, doing twice as many read/write
operations per memory location.  This causes it to use half the memory
as TwoCats and Yescrypt when memory bandwidth limited.  All of my ASIC
attack plans so far would need only half the memory to attack Lyra2
hashes, lowering it's time*memory defense by 2X.  However, a more
sophisticated attack might be able to take advantage of the unfilled
memory until it is needed, lowering the time*memory penalty to only a
3/4ths of TwoCats and Yescrypt.

For pure memory hashing speed per thread, TwoCats is the fastest,
followed by Lyra2, and then Yescrypt.  However, this is a deliberate
design choice by Alexander, and not significant weakness in Yescrypt,
as he demonstrated by slightly tweaking Yescrypt to be virtually as
fast per thread as TwoCats during a benchmarking fest.  The idea is
that the best defense occurs when all parts of the CPU and memory are
in use at the same time.  Yescrypt maxes out memory bandwidth at about
a CPU's full parallelism, which is when all cores are used to hash at
the same time.  TwoCats maxes out memory bandwidth with about 1/4 as
many threads, and cannot employ all CPU cores at the same time like
Yescrypt does.  The decision to max out CPUs vs trying to do the most
possible with one thread is based on the importance of different
scenarios.  For a low-powered single core processor, TwoCats will do
better than either Yescrypt or Lyra2, because multiple threads will
not help in that situation.  For high-end authentication servers
protecting passwords for major corporations, Yescrypt wins by
providing better computational hardness - an attacker will need many
SIMD unit's worth of processing power to run as fast as the
authentication server.  Once Lyra2 is upgraded with multi-threading,
it should do better than TwoCats, but worse than Yescrypt at
computational hardness (which is different than runtime hardness).
IMO, computational hardness matters little, since even multipliers are
tiny on an advanced ASIC.  Memory really is all that counts in terms
of silicon expense.

As for basic security, Yescrypt and TwoCats run well accepted
cryptographic hash functions on all inputs at the beginning to create
a derived key, and that key is hashed with the result of memory
hashing again with the cryptographic hash function at the end.
Regardless of any weakness in TwoCats or Yescrypt memory hashing, this
scheme will preserve entropy and will always hash at least as securely
as two applications of the cryptographic hash.  Lyra2 relies on the
reduced Blake2b function's application over and over many times while
hashing to cryptographically scramble it's sponge's state, and it
relies on this slightly modified Blake2b function to not lose entropy.
 The final output is squeezed from the sponge.  Because of this
construction, Lyra2 hashing security needs careful analysis by hashing
experts to verify it has no significant weakness.  I personally do not
feel qualified to do it.  However, I do believe that they most likely
got it right.  However, I would say TwoCats and Yescrypt win here, in
being trivial to prove basically secure.

TwoCats and Yescrypt win vs Lyra2 in terms of being ready for
deployment.  Lyra2 still uses memset to clear buffers, just as a
placeholder for the real function, and has no byte swapping to deal
with big-endian machines.  There is no provision for locking memory
from swap (mmap vs malloc).  It also still needs a thread upgrade,
while TwoCats and Yescrypt are in theory ready, other than needing
more review, for deployment now.  There are planned upgrades to
Yescrypt, but nothing critical, while TwoCats has a modified t_cost
loop that has not yet been submitted.  Lyra2 does not yet have a
parameter estimation function, while Yescrypt and TwoCats do.  In
reality, simply because Alexander makes so few mistakes, Yescrypt is
the closest entry of the three to being ready for deployment, edging
out a close win here vs TwoCats.

Of the three, Lyra2 has the simplest and most elegant design.  The
sponge construction was a pleasure to read, and cleverly done.
TwoCats probably comes in second here, simply because it inherits no
baggage from Scrypt, but complexity is a significant weakness of the
full TwoCats algorithm, which is why I also wrote the very simple
SinnyCat subset algorithm.  Starting with the complexity of Scrypt and
building on it made Yescrypt more complex than Lyra2 or TwoCats.  I
consider this to be the most significant weakness of Yescrypt, and the
most significant advantage of Lyra2.

Of the three, only TwoCats has a pluggable hash function, meaning that
it can easily run with different secure cryptographic hashes.  The
default is Blake2b for it's speed, but TwoCats comes with SHA256 and
SHA512 enabled as well.  This is only a minor weakness in Yescrypt,
because there is nothing in Yescrypt preventing this feature from
being added.  However, in Lyra2 it is fairly difficult to change the
underlying hash function.  Any change means that the algorithm needs
to be reviewed again carefully for any cryptographic weakness by
experts.  In contrast, any C programmer will find it trivial to change
the hash in TwoCats.

Yescrypt wins in another imporant category: ease of adoption.  While
remaining compatible with Scrypt has made Yescrypt more complex than
needed, it also makes it easier to deploy.  Anyone out there with
Scrypt already can simply replace it with Escrypt, and enjoy the
benefit of the higher speed in Alexander's implementation.  They can
easily switch to stronger hashing techniques provided in Yescrypt at
any time.  In contrast, users will have to learn about a whole new
hashing scheme to adopt TwoCats or Lyra2.
