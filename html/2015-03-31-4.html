Subject: Re: [PHC] Another PHC candidates "mechanical" tests (ROUND2)

I second Hongjun's argument about strong crypto: as-fast-as-possible
primitives need as few operations as possible, thus short chains of
operations need be crypto strong. OTOH, password hashing doesn't need
ultra high speed, thus can afford a high number of operations to
ensure that, even with suboptimally-secure building blocks, many
iterations will guarantee collision/preimage/pseudorandomness strength
etc.

MD5 with 256 instead of 64 rounds would probably be secure, for example :-)

&gt; Dear Alexander,
&gt;
&gt; First, I'd like to point out that the security of preimage/collision of
&gt; Pomelo (and some PHC Second round candidates) is somehow similar to the
&gt; security of the initialization of stream ciphers, rather than similar to the
&gt; security of hash function in which there is no secret key.
&gt;
&gt; When I was designing POMELO, the first priority is to ensure that the
&gt; password cannot be recovered due to collision (it follows from my experience
&gt; on the cryptanalysis and design of stream ciphers).  It is the reason that
&gt; the first half operations of POMELO are strictly revertible so as to prevent
&gt; collision, but to achieve diffusion.
&gt;
&gt; Some confusion/diffusion idea of POMELO partly comes from my stream cipher
&gt; HC (i.e., using expansion and table lookups).  Since its publication in
&gt; 2004, HC remains as a very strong cipher.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I will provide more analysis of POMELO in the updated report.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, I think that it is not necessary to use strong crypto primitive (such
&gt; as strong hash function) in the design of password  hashing scheme,
&gt; especially if we want to process large amount of memory in a fast way.
&gt; Eventually it turns out that a number of second round candidates need to cut
&gt; the round number significantly.   I feel that it is no longer true that
&gt; those PHC candidates are based on strong crypto primitives, although they
&gt; are still very strong.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe we can now say that most of the second round candidates are no longer
&gt; built on strong crypto primitives (such as strong hash functions or strong
&gt; block ciphers) to achieve their security,  not just POMELO itself.
&gt;
&gt; Best Regards,
&gt; hongjun

&gt;&gt; &gt; 3)  A strong hash function is not needed for POMELO.
&gt;&gt; &gt;      I believe that POMELO  is much stronger than any existing hash
&gt;&gt; &gt; function for the KDF/PH applications.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Most likely it is, but the confidence in it is currently lower than e.g.
&gt;&gt; in SHA-2 family functions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; (For performance reason, a strong
&gt;&gt; &gt; hash function has to be sufficiently fast and small.  So even in a very
&gt;&gt; &gt; strong hash function, not many operations can be used for processing a
&gt;&gt; &gt; message block.)
&gt;&gt; &gt;      In the POMELO report, I did not talk much about POMELO against
&gt;&gt; &gt; preimage and collision attack. I can explain more in the updated report.
&gt;&gt; &gt;      When I was designing POMELO v2,  only the memory hardening security
&gt;&gt; &gt; worth my analysis.   The preimage and collision security are trivial.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Of course, it's much easier (in fact, trivial as you say) to achieve
&gt;&gt; preimage and collision resistance in PHC candidates than in fast
&gt;&gt; cryptographic hashes.  The problem, though, is that "much easier" and
&gt;&gt; even "trivial" do not necessarily imply "has been achieved".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you tried to, I think you would be able to deliberately construct a
&gt;&gt; PHC candidate that would appear OK at first glance, but would not be
&gt;&gt; preimage or/and collision resistant.  Right?  And this might happen
&gt;&gt; unintentionally, too.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Simply speaking, the state size of POMELO is too large comparing to a
&gt;&gt; &gt; hash
&gt;&gt; &gt; function, and the operations used in a cryptographic hash function
&gt;&gt; &gt; (compression function) is much less than that used in POMELO.
&gt;&gt; &gt;      Some example: considering SHA-512, there are only 64+64 = 128
&gt;&gt; &gt; simple
&gt;&gt; &gt; steps to compress a 128-byte message (if we consider message expansion
&gt;&gt; &gt; as
&gt;&gt; &gt; 64 steps); while in POMELO v2, there are about 3*256 = 768 steps when
&gt;&gt; &gt; m_cost = 0, t_cost = 0.     In POMELO v2, in order to prevent password
&gt;&gt; &gt; hashing being too fast, it is required that m_cost + t_cost &gt;= 5.  It
&gt;&gt; &gt; means
&gt;&gt; &gt; that POMELO v2 consists of at least 32*256+512 = 8704 steps, far more
&gt;&gt; &gt; than
&gt;&gt; &gt; that in a compression function of SHA-512.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Simply comparing the number of operations is not convincing enough.
&gt;&gt; For example, what if most of those cancel out, or are reversible, or if
&gt;&gt; there are tiny biases that add up to something significant after so many
&gt;&gt; steps?  This is almost certainly not the case, but until shown otherwise
&gt;&gt; the possibilities are there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A more realistic risk is issues with how the password and salt inputs
&gt;&gt; are processed early on.  Things like the original bcrypt $2$'s trivial
&gt;&gt; collisions for "ab" vs. "abab", etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think it's reasonable that people want an analysis of POMELO's basic
&gt;&gt; security.
