&gt; 
&gt; I think we can proceed with that if Pufferfish becomes a finalist. 
&gt; I don't expect any issues there that couldn't be easily tweaked.
&gt; 
&gt; However:
&gt; 
&gt; Bill, you were going to do pre-final-hashing randomness tests on
&gt; all PHC candidates.  What's happened to that plan?

The TrueCrypt fork happened :-)

&gt;&gt; In short, PufferFish is very similar to bcrypt, except that the
&gt;&gt; 4 S-boxes can be bigger, controlled by m_cost, and the iteration
&gt;&gt; count is controlled by t_cost.  It uses 64-bit arithmetic, and
&gt;&gt; just in case it's this modified version of BlowFish is not very
&gt;&gt; secure, it hashes the inputs first with SHA512-HMAC.  The author
&gt;&gt; got the details of the password and salt hashing right, working
&gt;&gt; around the input collisions of HMAC.  Very nice!
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the pre-hashing is needed to avoid a bcrypt-like password
&gt; length limit.  For bcrypt it's 72; while 144 would be much better
&gt; and would satisfy PHC requirements as-is (128+), it would still be
&gt; a drawback.

I'll take your word for this, but I don't understand!  The S-boxes are
initialized with SHA512 data, and the password and salt are properly
hashed with SHA512-HMAC in a way that avoids the HMAC input
collisions.  What further pre-hashing could there be?

&gt;&gt; Overall, for an algorithm that simply wants to extend the life
&gt;&gt; of bcrypt by using more than 4KiB of L1 cache and using 64-bit
&gt;&gt; data types, PufferFish looks great.  It's nice to have an easy
&gt;&gt; review for Labor Day :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Great.
&gt; 
&gt; A drawback of going 64-bit, yet keeping the 4x lookups parallelism,
&gt; is that Pufferfish may be 2x weaker than bcrypt on old or low-end
&gt; 32-bit systems (e.g. some ARM), which use little instruction-level
&gt; parallelism.

Probably.  If there is no 64-bit addition or XOR, the 4 unpredictable
reads might still go fast, but the two 64-bit XORs and the 64-bit ADD
might take another 3 cycles compared to regular bcrypt, because of the
two extra 32-bit XORs and the extra add-with-carry.

&gt; On newer and high-end 32-bit systems, I think the extra parallelism
&gt; is fine, as seen via bcrypt attack vs. defense speedup on CPUs,
&gt; which is up to 2x on many x86-64 CPUs.  In fact, Pufferfish might
&gt; still lack enough parallelism to fully use modern x86-64 CPUs in
&gt; 64-bit mode, with 1 instance of it per core, so CPU-based attacks
&gt; may achieve some speedup by interleaving (like we do for attacks on
&gt; bcrypt).  This may be a fine tradeoff, though, since like I said
&gt; adding more parallelism "hurts" defensive use on smaller systems
&gt; (or more precisely, it provides speedup to attacks on some kinds of
&gt; hardware without a matching speedup for defensive use on those
&gt; smaller systems).  Making instruction-level parallelism
&gt; configurable would add complexity.

Also, to defend against attacker parallelism, using the whole L1 cache
could be somewhat effective, since the S-box sizes are configurable.

&gt; Many other PHC entries, including yescrypt at default settings,
&gt; share this sort of drawback too.  So Pufferfish isn't actually
&gt; worse than them when run on too-old or too-small CPUs.  It's just
&gt; that many PHC entries are (in a way) worse than bcrypt on too-old
&gt; and too-small CPUs.  I'm considering ways of dealing with that in
&gt; yescrypt (non-default settings for such uses; yescrypt is very
&gt; generic and complicated anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; Alexander

I should probably benchmark PufferFish, but I've got a ton of reviews
to get through first.  From the code, I suspect it performs on par
with bcrypt in terms of unpredictable memory accesses per second.
Because of this, and it's bcrypt-like simplicity, I'm currently
picking PufferFish as my first choice for a pure bcrypt replacement,
though not for an Scrypt replacement.  Being a bit slower on older
machines is probably OK, IMO, given how long it will take for adoption.
