&gt; I like this last one.  This should get rid of the modulo 4
&gt; simplifications.  It adds another operation in the inner loop, and
&gt; it's the worst kind: the right-shift requires nothing but wires in an
&gt; ASIC.  Still, this is what I'll try next if needed.

Yes, the worst kind.  Also, the XOR is only 2-bit.  Unfortunately.

The only reason to choose this is that it's not entirely arbitrary but
is also used in MT and thus has been a target for attacks for a while.

Also, regarding latencies and throughput for various integer multiply
instructions on x86 and x86-64, including several SIMD forms, it is
really non-obvious whether to choose 16x16-&gt;hi16(32) or 32x32-&gt;32 or
32x32-&gt;64 or 64x64-&gt;64 or even 64x64-&gt;128 for the primitive, especially
if we're considering supporting SIMD (tunable).  Up until Haswell and
Avoton (8-core Atom for servers), things were much clearer (32x32-&gt;32
had at most 5 cycles latency in 4x SIMD form on CPUs supporting such
SIMD form), but those two microarchitectures, which we can't disregard
now since both will be found on new servers, have messed the timings up -
or maybe we're lucky to see this change (trend?) now rather than when
it'd be too late.

Based on data from <a href="http://users.atw.hu/instlatx64/" rel="nofollow">http://users.atw.hu/instlatx64/</a> for currently most
relevant CPUs, which I think are Intel's Core 2 through Haswell and
Avoton, and AMD's Bulldozer/Piledriver, I got this:

PMULHW		16x16-&gt;hi16 signed	MMX(x4) - AVX2(x16)	L: 3-5	T: 1-2
PMULHUW		16x16-&gt;hi16 unsigned	SSE(x4),SSE2(x8),...	L: 3-5	T: 1-2
PMULHRSW	16x16-&gt;16 fixed point	SSSE3(x8), AVX2(x16)	L: 3-5  T: 1-2

PMULDQ		32x32-&gt;64 signed	SSE4(x2), AVX2(x4)	L: 3-5	T: 1-2
PMULUDQ		32x32-&gt;64 unsigned	SSE2(x2), AVX2(x4)	L: 3-5	T: 1-2

PMULLD		32x32-&gt;32		SSE4(x4), AVX2(x8)	L: 5-11	T: 1-11

IMUL		32x32-&gt;32		x86			L: 3-4	T: 1-2
IMUL		64x64-&gt;64		x86-64			L: 3-6	T: 1-4

[I]MUL		32x32-&gt;64		x86			L: 4-5	T: 4-5
[I]MUL		64x64-&gt;128		x86-64			L: 4-7	T: 3-7

These also appear to hold true for Pentium Pro family (PPro, P2, P3, and
P2/P3 Celeron), for the instructions that exist on those CPUs, but not
for P4 (which is slower, with its worst case appearing to be at L: 21
T: 11 for 64x64-&gt;128), nor for 1990's original Pentium P54C (L: 9 T: 9).

As you can see, my old favorite PMULLD has really bad worst-case latency
and even worse throughput, all due to Haswell and Avoton.  On Haswell,
it has 10 cycles latency (not only for the new 8x AVX2 form, but also
for the old 4x SSE4.1/AVX form) and 2 cycles throughput (I take it to
mean we'll have 5 SIMD vectors go through the pipeline in the 10 cycles).
In terms of 32-bit MULs/second throughput, this is fully compensated for
by the doubling of vector width with AVX2 (when we're able to use that
extra width), but 10 cycles latency is just inappropriate for our
purpose, because we know an ASIC will cut it to 3 cycles.  On Avoton,
it's even worse: 11 cycles for both latency and throughput, and it only
has SSE4.1, so we'll get only 4 32-bit MULs per 11 cycles on it.

On all CPUs in the Core 2 to Ivy Bridge range, PMULLD is 5 cycles
latency (and 1 or 2 cycles throughput), so it's only moderately worse in
terms of latency than non-SIMD 32-bit multiplies (which are 3 or 4
cycles latency).  So it would be within consideration.

As a workaround, if we favor lower latency over higher throughput,
maybe we should combine two PMULUDQ's to produce a lower-latency
equivalent of PMULLD when running on Haswell and Avoton (for Avoton,
this would produce much higher throughput too).  I've experimented with
such emulation briefly, albeit in context of adding SSE2 support to
php_mt_seed (which previously required SSE4.1+ for any SIMD at all),
where plenty of parallelism is available (so I did not measure the
effect on latency).  Here are my emulated _mm_mullo_epi32()'s (normally
SSE4.1+) with SSE2 intrinsics:

#ifdef __GNUC__
#if 0
#define _mm_mullo_epi32(a, b) ({ \
		__m128i _a = (a), _b = (b); \
		__m128i p = _mm_mul_epu32(_a, _b); \
		__m128i q = _mm_mul_epu32(_mm_srli_epi64(_a, 32), \
		    _mm_srli_epi64(_b, 32)); \
		_mm_unpacklo_epi64( \
		_mm_unpacklo_epi32(p, q), \
		_mm_unpackhi_epi32(p, q)); \
	})
#else
#define _mm_mullo_epi32(a, b) ({ \
		__m128i _a = (a), _b = (b); \
		_mm_unpacklo_epi32( \
		    _mm_shuffle_epi32(_mm_mul_epu32(_a, _b), 0x08), \
		    _mm_shuffle_epi32(_mm_mul_epu32(_mm_srli_epi64(_a, 32), \
		    _mm_srli_epi64(_b, 32)), 0x08)); \
	})
#endif
#else
#define _mm_mullo_epi32(a, b) \
	_mm_unpacklo_epi32( \
	    _mm_shuffle_epi32(_mm_mul_epu32((a), (b)), 0x08), \
	    _mm_shuffle_epi32(_mm_mul_epu32(_mm_srli_epi64((a), 32), \
	    _mm_srli_epi64((b), 32)), 0x08))
#endif

Instead of _mm_srli_epi64(..., 32), we may use _mm_srli_si128(..., 4) -
which of these is faster and which is slower varies by CPU type.

I think this can be optimized (manually) when put in specific context -
there's not always a need to have the vector elements in the same order
(and even in the same vectors) as with _mm_mullo_epi32() proper.

I think this adds at best 4 cycles of latency on top of PMULUDQ's 5
cycles (on Haswell and Avoton), bringing the total latency to at least
9, which is only 1 or 2 cycles better than those arch's native PMULLD.
Maybe the context-specific optimization I mentioned can bring this
closer to 5 cycles latency.

This makes me think that maybe we actually want to depend on a 32x32-&gt;64
expanding multiply.  It's 3 to 5 cycles latency with SIMD, and also 3 to
5 without (3 is reached by using x86-64's 64x64-&gt;64 with 32-bit inputs,
otherwise it's minimum 4 cycles for non-SIMD) - so no harm from SIMD, as
long as our algorithm is chosen such that no vector element shuffling is
needed.

Some other forms look somewhat attractive as well.
