&gt; I think this is underselling the fact that the GPU code is entirely
&gt; "portable" C, whereas the CPU code is highly optimized assembly. I
&gt; don't know the AMD toolchain enough to know whether this makes any
&gt; difference, but on old CUDA I vaguely recall getting a ~15k/s -&gt;
&gt; ~30k/s performance boost from switching from C to inline PTX assembly
&gt; on a few key routines. So there is some potential for the GPU to get a
&gt; modest advantage factor, I think.

The AMD toolchain is, let's say, uninspiring (I got it to miscompile
code sometimes, and also to brutally segfault). The concept is that you
write a "kernel" in sort-of C code, that gets compiled at runtime (you
can save and reload the resulting binary, as an option, but the
principle of OpenCL is still to normally recompile at runtime). In the
AMD toolchain, when targeting a GPU, the compilation first produces what
AMD calls "IL" as "intermediate language" (roughly the equivalent of
NVidia's PTX), which gets then translated to assembly for the actual
device, something that AMD calls "ISA" (as "instruction set
architecture").

AMD IL is documented there:
   <a href="http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/AMD_Intermediate_Language_%28IL%29_Specification_v2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/AMD_Intermediate_Language_%28IL%29_Specification_v2.pdf</a>

AMD ISA (for "Southern Islands" GPU, like the HD 7990) is described in:
   <a href="http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/12/AMD_Southern_Islands_Instruction_Set_Architecture.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/12/AMD_Southern_Islands_Instruction_Set_Architecture.pdf</a>

Since OpenCL is meant to allow support of heterogeneous systems, they
voluntarily keep the developer away from that. You are supposed to write
"plain C" and let the OpenCL runtime do its magic, so that optimal
performance on a wide range of architectures is achieved (this does not
actually work well, or even at all, but that's another debate(**)).
Correspondingly, there is no supported method for inline assembly. There
are some reports that you _can_ use asm() statements that the AMD tools
will use, and that way you might include some hand-written statements in
the IL (not the ISA). However, this is completely undocumented, and, in
particular, it is unclear how you would specify constraints so that the
compiler maps C-level variables to registers and back.

Another method would be to go straight for the compiled kernel format,
which is supported as an option by OpenCL; in the case of AMD GPU, this
appears to be some kind of ELF object, but not fully documented. Some
people are trying to write such an assembler:
   <a href="http://openwall.info/wiki/john/development/GCN-ISA">http://openwall.info/wiki/john/development/GCN-ISA</a>
but, as far as I know, this is not completely usable yet.


Nevertheless...

While you do not get to _write_ assembly, you can observe it. When you
build the kernel, you can add some options (as a string), one of them
being "-save-temps", which triggers the writing down of some files,
containing, respectively, the kernel quasi-C code, the IL, and the ISA.
With these files, you can see what the compiler produced from the C
code, in particular the chosen sequence of instructions, as well as the
"register spilling" situation. This leads to an uncomfortable by still
workable optimization method, by which you tweak the C code until the
compiler happens to produce the sequence of opcodes (ISA) that you
would have written yourself (if the tools had allowed it).

In the case of my code, I duly verified that the sequence of opcodes
really is what it should be. In my fastest implementation (with 31-bit
words), I get this sequence (repeated 67 times, with varying source
registers) for the inner loop:

  v_mul_hi_u32  v132, v13, v88
  v_mul_lo_u32  v140, v13, v88
  v_add_i32     v68, s[82:83], v68, v140
  v_addc_u32    v69, vcc, v69, v132, vcc
  v_mul_hi_u32  v132, s27, v86
  v_mul_lo_u32  v140, s27, v86
  v_add_i32     v68, s[84:85], v68, v140
  v_addc_u32    v69, vcc, v69, v132, s[82:83]
  v_addc_u32    v69, vcc, v69, 0, s[84:85]
  v_and_b32     v132, 0x7fffffff, v68
  v_lshr_b64    v[68:69], v[68:69], 31
  v_add_i32     v68, vcc, v130, v68

which is what I wanted. We see the two 32x32-&gt;64 multiplications
(v_mul_hi_u32 and v_mul_lo_u32), the 64-bit additions (v_add_i32 and
v_addc_u32, for carry propagation), and the masking and shifting to get
back to 31-bit words. Note that opcode latency is not an issue for GPU
(that one, or even GPU in general) because the hardware will interleave
kernel executions; so results from an opcode can be used by the next
opcode with no penalty.

If I were to write assembly manually, I would not do any better, so the
current implementation is as good as it can get. Inline assembly would
not help here (a smarter representation of integers might help, but
that's a completely different issue(**)). A consequence is that I think
it is fair to compare my OpenCL code with optimized assembly for the
CPU: because my OpenCL code _is_ optimized assembly, albeit done
indirectly, through a C-based interface, which increased optimization
_effort_, but did not, in that case, decrease final performance.

(*) When you compile OpenCL code for a CPU with SIMD instructions like
SSE2 opcodes, you have to use the "vector types" explicitly (like
'uint4'); otherwise, the compiler will not automatically vectorize the
code, which means that optimal code for the GPU and for the CPU will be
distinct at the OpenCL level. While the _concept_ is fine, actual
implementations are not up to the task right now.

(**) I am not entirely convinced that FFT-based multiplication would not
be worth a try here, though I am quite hazy on the details and in
particular how modular reduction would intervene here.
