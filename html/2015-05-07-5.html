&gt; It took some time, but we finally completed the GPU benchmarks mentioned
&gt; in the e-mail below, both for Lyra2 and yescrypt. We did not use djm34's
&gt; yescrypt GPU implementation mentioned in another thread, though, because
&gt; while Lyra2 has been in their repository for a few months, we had
&gt; already adapted the yescrypt-opt version when we learned the news a few
&gt; days ago... Some optimizations made there might apply to our code too,
&gt; so we will take a look.

Yes, djm34's code looks more optimal to me.  yescrypt-opt actually isn't
as optimized as yescrypt-simd, not only in terms of lacking explicit SIMD.
It also includes blk{cpy,xor}, whereas those are avoided in -simd and
are avoidable in -opt.  I just didn't bother yet (in part because their
relative performance impact is lower when the code is non-SIMD; but on
GPU you get SIMD code, it's just implicit).

This makes me wonder: are you benchmarking your CUDA code against
yescrypt-simd or possibly against yescrypt-opt on CPU?  Your
readme_attacks.txt says: "We used the PHC code for each algorithm and
the fastest version (generally, the vectorized version)."  This suggests
that you used yescrypt-simd on CPU, but I'd like to make sure.

&gt; Anyhow, the partial results indicate that Lyra2 is actually more
&gt; GPU-resistant than yescrypt for a memory usage of 256 kB to 2 MB, at
&gt; least for our GPU (GeForce GTX TITAN),

This is very interesting if so.  But I don't buy your results yet, as I
explained in another message.  Your reported yescrypt CPU speeds are in
weird units, and if I try to convert them (even though they can't be),
I get way lower speeds than what I am seeing.

Your readme_attacks.txt says "The password derivation time is the total
test time divided by number of passwords tested." under "GPU attacks".
Great, but is it the same on CPU?  If not, that's wrong.  If yes, it
doesn't match my results (by far).

I think you actually used a different metric on CPU, per readme_attacks.txt:

"The CPU benchmarks focused in legitm usage of the kdfs.

	To obtain the medium execution time:
	- We executed "n" times each derivation;
	- With the parameters seted accordingly with parallelism and memory usage desired."

While this would make sense for KDF use at large m_cost, it doesn't for
password hashing use at low m_cost.  You should use a throughput figure
for CPU, just like you do for GPU.

&gt; in all test scenarios we considered, namely:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Different block lengths (C=128 and C=256 for Lyra2, yescrypt's
&gt; defaults), degrees of parallelism (1, 2 or 4, for both algorithms), and
&gt; passes through memory (T=0 and 2 for yescrypt, T=1 for Lyra2, since this
&gt; corresponds both to minimal and "same number of passes through memory"
&gt; for the schemes).

OK.  I suggest that you lock p=1 and add 12 threads externally for both
yescrypt and Lyra2, for your E5-2430.

&gt; 2) Different attack geometries, scripting to find the best GPU
&gt; throughput (i.e., the number of parallel guesses that resulted in the
&gt; lowest time taken per test) and also testing the number of threads per
&gt; warp that would give the best results (32 threads per warp means full
&gt; warp occupation, but the best throughput is obtained with 8 threads per
&gt; warp and one warp per block).

This sounds good to me.  Locking p=1 should save you time on this.

&gt; The numbers in the GPU are equivalent for Blake2b and BlaMka, so we
&gt; included just the former here (note: since BlaMka is slightly slower
&gt; than Blake2b in the CPU, the advantage of the GPU over the CPU when
&gt; BlaMka is employed should be slightly higher too, but the GPU still
&gt; loses in most scenarios).

Makes sense.  MUL isn't expected to be much slower than simpler
operations on GPU.

&gt; Since the results may change to other GPUs, we placed the code employed
&gt; in our git (<a href="https://github.com/leocalm/Lyra/tree/master/GPU_attacks" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/leocalm/Lyra/tree/master/GPU_attacks</a> ),
&gt; so anyone can confirm/refute our numbers. Also, any bug report or
&gt; optimization suggestion is very welcome! We tried a few tricks and
&gt; checked the test vectors, but we may have missed something.

I appreciate this.  I took a look via GitHub's web interface.
Unfortunately, this fails:

&gt; &gt; Yes, and in your CPU benchmarks too, so you'd be comparing GPU attacks

&gt; 
&gt; We did not include bcrypt to the benchmarks because we wanted to have
&gt; comparisons against a memory-hard scheme, so we did so for yescrypt.

I'd make sense to include bcrypt, too.  Especially if you claim that
your GPU outperforms CPU at yescrypt despite of pwxform's rapid random
lookups, it becomes extremely relevant that you show the same for
bcrypt, because yescrypt-simd's rapid random lookups are on par with
bcrypt's when both are run defensively on a modern x86 CPU.

(Of course, I expect that your results will change once you correct your
methodology.)

yescrypt as currently defined might or might not see a lot of use, but
bcrypt is already in use and there are already results for its GPU
unfriendliness.  So far, it runs very slow on GTX TITAN such as yours,
much slower than on CPU (at full thread count, indeed).

There are promising (for attackers) results for bcrypt on NVIDIA
Maxwell, though: up to 14440 c/s at stock clocks, 16890 c/s at +225 MHz
o/c on Titan X as per benchmarks by Jeremi Gosney (thanks, Jeremi!)
For comparison, i7-4770K runs bcrypt defensively at 4300 c/s and attacks
it at 6600 c/s.  All of this is for bcrypt cost 5.

&gt; It is still unclear if there is a point in which yescrypt becomes more
&gt; GPU-resistant than Lyra2, but it does not appear to be at 256 KB or
&gt; higher, at least for our GPU.

Maybe, or maybe not.  Let's see proper benchmarks, then revisit this. :-)

&gt; Alexander: is there a memory range in which the table look-ups are
&gt; expected to make a large difference? I mean, we are testing smaller
&gt; ranges now, but since the tests take quite some time due to the search
&gt; for the best attack geometry, your suggestions on where to start would
&gt; be welcome.

I'd use 128 KB to 2 MB at p=1 simply because these are most practically
relevant for this test.

It might be that things are fine at 128+ KB even without the rapid
random lookups on specific GPUs.  My goal was to have some assurance of
being no worse than bcrypt, and this provides it.  We never know what
the bottleneck might be on a future device.  Right now, the sheer size
of X (the current block) at r=8 might be sufficient (but I am skeptical
about this, see below).  On another device, it might not be.

The GPU attack benchmarks reported for scrypt so far show huge
difference for r=1 vs. r=8, with the latter being much more GPU
resistant.  128 KB with r=1 is Litecoin, and we know that it runs on
GPUs very fast (they make it 64 KB via TMTO, though).  I am skeptical
when people say (based on actual benchmarks, of course) that r=8 runs
more than 3x slower.  I think this might very well be an attack
implementation shortcoming that might be repaired.  Specifically, while
I fully agree that r=8 might reduce the number of current instances by 8
times if we fit X in local memory, this might mean that placing it in
global memory becomes more optimal.  And once we do, I don't see it as
very different from other blocks being read from and written to V.
That's where my "3x" comes from.  And 3x slower than Litecoin is still
very fast (just not as fast).

In our current experiments with POMELO on GPU, we're also testing 8 KB
and 32 KB.  I don't see these as practically relevant (given that even
glibc managed to use 128 KB for its descrypt code for what, 2 decades
now?) but they are fine to include when we're figuring things out.

BTW, yescrypt adds 8 KB S-boxes to what's requested by m_cost.  So when
you request 128 KB, you actually get 136 KB, etc.  For 8 KB requested
(at PHS m_cost=0), this means you get 16 KB... but at sizes this low
other overhead plays a role as well anyway.

&gt; The only situation in which we got Lyra2 running faster on our GPU than
&gt; on our CPU was for p=1 and 8 threads per warp (for 256KB).

You mean when you used unoptimal settings on GPU and didn't fully use
the CPU?  This doesn't count, for either or both of these reasons.

So you would be fine, except that ...

&gt; For yescrypt,
&gt; that happened in most of our tests (see graphs in the third column:
&gt; anything below 1 means that the GPU is winning).

... your methodology looks flawed, for both Lyra2 and yescrypt.

So at this time we don't know much about either Lyra2's or yescrypt's
performance on GPU.  Not from these results yet, at least.

&gt; Actually, we did some testing with yescrypt code (e.g., commenting some
&gt; lines) and it appears that the table lookups do not make much difference
&gt; on this range, but what is hurting the GPU is rather the memory
&gt; transference from/to the X and Y buffers. We would have to execute a
&gt; runtime analyzer to be sure, though, which is in our TODO list.

I've indirectly commented on this above.  I did expect the X and Y
buffers to have this sort of effect, after I saw people's benchmarks of
scrypt at r &gt; 1.  However, I think pwxform rapid lookups are still
needed as well.

Even if we look at local memory usage (so disregard the fact that X and
Y are candidates for global memory at not as much overhead as would be
seen for S-boxes), X and Y are 2 KB combined at r=8.  pwxform S-boxes
are 8 KB.  So that's a 5x increase in local memory needed per instance
when we add the S-boxes.  If this has no performance effect, there's
something wrong/suboptimal with the attack.

Oh, or do you mean you preserved the local memory allocation for the
S-boxes, but did not use them?  Then your results make more sense to me.
It is possible that you bumped into another performance bottleneck,
making this one irrelevant in your case.

Anyway, we need proper benchmarks first.

I am sorry that my messages might sound dismissive.  Once again, I
appreciate your work on this a lot, and I think you got very close to
producing valuable results here.

Thanks again,

Alexander
