&gt;&gt; So my overall suggestion is make it easier on the developer using the
&gt;&gt; API, rather than the one writing it. After all, there are going to be
&gt;&gt; FAR more people writing a salt string then there will be writing the
&gt;&gt; backend implementation. Optimize for the greater use-case...
&gt;
&gt; Here's an idea in the above context:
&gt;
&gt; We can have our crypt()-like API accept both compact and human-friendly
&gt; "setting strings", but output only compact encodings.  This takes care
&gt; of making it easy for application developers to generate new hashes via
&gt; languages' existing crypt() API without waiting for a new API to be
&gt; introduced.  It also prevents such application developers from
&gt; influencing the actual encoding (order of parameters seen in final
&gt; encodings, etc.)  For example:
&gt;
&gt; crypt("password", "$7X$logN=14,r=8")
&gt;
&gt; as well as e.g.:
&gt;
&gt; crypt("password", "$7X$p=1,r=8,N=16384")
&gt;
&gt; could return something looking like:
&gt;
&gt; $7X$B5$Pwm/zQAIhEVTKlaoJSA7TQ$kBGj9fHznVYFQMEn/qDCfrDevf9YDtcDdKvEqHJLV8D
&gt;
&gt; Of course, crypt() would also return the same string if called as:
&gt;
&gt; crypt("password", "$7X$B5$Pwm/zQAIhEVTKlaoJSA7TQ")

I guess my point here is more why does the compact encoding need to
exist? Why can't the encoding that was passed in be returned (assuming
it was valid in the first place)?

And is there really a need for a compact encoding in the first place?
I guess I always prefer explicitness over byte savings. Even in the
worst case situation where you're storing billions of passwords,
you're talking about saving perhaps 20 gigabytes out of a total of at
least 100gb. Yes, 20% is not insignificant, but even 20gb is a trivial
amount of data to basically any system (especially one with billions
of users).

&gt; With PHP's password_hash()/password_verify() API, the human-friendly
&gt; parsing would need to be enabled in password_hash(), but not
&gt; (necessarily) in password_verify().  Currently password_hash() accepts a
&gt; numeric $algo, but maybe we simply need to introduce PASSWORD_ANY (any
&gt; better name for it?) and have the actual choice made by a $setting
&gt; string that will follow.

So password_verify() will accept any arbitrary crypt() hash. That way
you pass in whatever, and it will confirm it for you.

password_hash() acts as a format-generator, a high-level API to
generate that setting string so you don't have to.

So I would forsee (with sane defaults for interactive usage):

    $hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_ARGONI);

And if you wanted to specify parameters, they would go into the options array:

    $hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_ARGONI, ["logN" =&gt; 15]);

The actual salt will be generated for you, as well as the string put
together. Whichever format it wants to generate doesn't matter to the
outside, that's all abstracted away.

The password_verify would accept any valid hash (so a migration path
to upgrade in-place could be implemented).

The one question I have is if we want to do a first-order
approximation of "cost" with an algorithm, so individual engineers
(the target of said API) don't need to learn about the individual
parameters and the tradeoffs. So we can say "use cost 10, but try 11
or 12 and see the runtime to see if it's OK for your server), and have
that cost value be derived into the appropriate settings for the
algorithm for that "cost". I don't know if this is a good idea or not,
just something I've been thinking about.

Remember, the target for password_* is normal web developers, not
security experts. They will not understand the tradeoffs that the
algorithms make (whether they should or not is irrelevant, they
won't). That's why password_* aims to be a high-level abstraction, not
just a re-invention of crypt (it serves a different consumer).

&gt; Then we could also have an API for decoding compact to human-friendly
&gt; strings, but it would mostly be used for debugging and such, and it
&gt; wouldn't need to already be in place for apps to start using the new
&gt; hashes.  And yes, potentially needing something like this for debugging
&gt; is a drawback of not using a human-friendly encoding everywhere.

Yeah, that's my feeling. We're not talking about saving a huge amount
of storage space here. Even the largest websites in the world would be
saving on the scale of test of gigabytes. Small enough that it feels
like a micro-optimization to me. I'd rather the entire thing be human
readable.

But that's just my view. And I could very well be wrong here (or be
missing something).

Thanks

Anthony
