&gt;&gt; One thing we can prove is that a PHS that attempts to be a secure
&gt;&gt; memory-hard algorithm is "strongly secure" in the sense that we've
&gt;&gt; hashed all the inputs to meet that definition, and have preserved
&gt;&gt; entropy all the way to the output.  Both yescript and TwoCats pass
&gt;&gt; this test, as well as several others, I think.  All you have to show
&gt;&gt; is your code works something like:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; PRK = H(all inputs, including lengths)
&gt;&gt; X = whateverHashAlgorithm(PRK)
&gt;&gt; output H(PRK || X)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would call anything like this a "strongly secure PHS".  I'm not
&gt;&gt; really thinking about the non-memory-hard PHS's which seem to take
&gt;&gt; radically different approaches.  Some of the memory-hard PHS's look
&gt;&gt; more like:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; PRK = H(all inputs, including lengths)
&gt;&gt; X = whateverHashAlgorithm(PRK)
&gt;&gt; output H(X)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example, I think Scrypt, Catena, and Gambit look more like this.
&gt;
&gt; scrypt includes the password in the final H(), but it doesn't include
&gt; the salt in there.  So if anything goes wrong in scrypt's
&gt; whateverHashAlgorithm(), it might lose salt entropy, but not password
&gt; entropy (except to the extent H() loses entropy).
&gt;
&gt; yescrypt includes the entire PRK in the final H(), but the initial
&gt; calculation of PRK includes {password, salt} yet doesn't include {N, r,
&gt; p, t, flags}.  I think this is a good choice, but if this community
&gt; feels the parameters also need to be included in the entropy bypass to
&gt; final H hash (why?), I am willing to add that in the tweaks period.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'd have to double check to be sure.  These schemes require more proof
&gt;&gt; that entropy is not lost, but since they use familiar cryptographic
&gt;&gt; primitives for all hashing, they seem pretty safe to me.  The ones
&gt;&gt; that don't use any cryptographic primitives at all are the scary ones
&gt;&gt; to me.  Using the dieharder tests, we're already showing that some of
&gt;&gt; those are not very well put together, at least in their submitted
&gt;&gt; form.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for these tests you're running.
&gt;
&gt; Once you're done with the basic tests, I think we should also attack the
&gt; "strongly secure" hashes in a weakened form: removing PRK from the final
&gt; H().  My intent is that yescrypt should pass randomness tests in that
&gt; weakened form as well (if it doesn't, I'll tweak it until it does, but I
&gt; expect that it does already).  This is similar e.g. to attacking
&gt; reduced-round versions of ciphers and fast hashes, or attacking their
&gt; individual components (a closer analogy perhaps).
&gt;
&gt; Taking this a step further, we can test X instead of H(PRK || X).
&gt;
&gt; If a "strongly secure" hash weakened as above fails randomness tests,
&gt; this likely indicates that its whateverHashAlgorithm()'s cost may be
&gt; fully or partially avoided by the attacker in a subset of cases.  Then
&gt; we could analyze whether this has practical impact (which will depend on
&gt; the size of this subset and how quickly an attacker is able to trigger
&gt; the bypass and with what overhead on inputs that don't trigger the
&gt; bypass), or/and count it as a reason against that scheme (until it's
&gt; tweaked to avoid this problem).
&gt;
&gt; Alexander

Ok, this is all really unfair.  Of course we should attack X exactly
as you say.  I think I should skip attacking H(X) (without PRK).  An
author with a weak X has work to do.  Now I'm not going to be able to
sleep for another week!  Aren't we supposed to shooting the s*, and
talk about integrating FPGA programmability into multi-CPU thingies at
this point :-)
