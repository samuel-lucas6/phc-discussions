&gt; Dear all,
&gt;
&gt; As an example, let the password hashing function H1 be ten times faster
&gt; than H2, i.e., if Mallory's costs for H1 are be ten times higher than his
&gt; costs for H2 (for the same budget on the defender's side). Ten times faster
&gt; sounds like a big deal, doesn't it?
&gt;

Mallory's cost will be 100X higher in this case.  Memory*time defense goes
as the square of the runtime.  So, that's 6.64 additional bits of strength,
not 3.32.


&gt; Well, the H1 would provide log_2(10)=3.32 bit more pseudo-entropy than H2.
&gt; To compensate for using H2, the defender could choose passwords, with 3.32
&gt; bit of additional entropy. Just appending one single random digit to the
&gt; password would suffice.
&gt;

Given the low entropy per character in most passwords, 6.4 bits will
require an additional 2 characters.


&gt; Even if the defender does not really understand how Mallory might mount a
&gt; side-channel attack against H1, choosing H1 for the marginal gain of a ten
&gt; times better performance could be a fatal move, if H2 is resistant to
&gt; side-channel attacks. The most serious issue are cache-timing attacks, but
&gt; one should also consider garbage collector attacks, and possibly other
&gt; attacks as well.
&gt;

I consider garbage collector attacks to be a more common side-channel than
cache-timing.  Yescrypt does a good job overwriting early memory fast, so
that there's less chance of a devistating garbage collector attack.  I
prefer what I did in TwoCats, which minimizes early garbage collector
attacks by using a Catena-style increasing garlic, up to some reasonable
size.

As for side-channel resistance, Lyra2 (especially if we enhance it's early
walk pattern) has a cache-timing resistant first loop, significantly
reducing the damage from a successful cache-timing attack.  Alexander has
considered adding such a loop to Yescrypt, and I have it in TwoCats (not a
finalist).  I find this to be the most acceptable compromise between
reduced time*memory defense and having any resistance to a cache timing
attack.  If we could improve Lyra2's performance a bit, it would look
really good, IMO.


&gt; (Note that the situation for password-based key derivation, is different.
&gt; There, can hardly exclude Mallory from performing off-line attacks. Except
&gt; when Mallory doesn't have the ciphertext -- but then, why should Mallory
&gt; care for the key or the password at all?)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The consequence for PHC?
&gt;
&gt; If PHC selects a single winner from one of the finalists, it should either
&gt; be Argon2i or Catena. If PHC selects more than one winner, the set of
&gt; winners should include at least one of Argon2i and Catena. (Or, if we don't
&gt; care about forcing Mallory to allocate a large amount of memory, Makwa and
&gt; Parallel would be alternatives.
&gt;

I strongly disagree.  Cache timing attacks remain a laboratory experiment,
while millions of passwords are being leaked through off-line attacks.
Argon2i or Catena as a sole winner would be much worse for defense against
these real-world off-line attacks than Scrypt.  If there is only one
winner, it _must_ at least provide better off-line attack resistance than
Scrypt.  Otherwise, we'll just continue using Scrypt.  I would prefer
having some cache-timing resistance if there were just one winner, which is
a point in Lyra2's favor.  We could either add a hybrid archtecture to
Argon2d or Yescrypt, or speed up Lyra2 a bit, and we'd be fine with a
single winner, IMO.

However, I would prefer to have two winners, one from the fast large-memory
multi-threaded group (Argon2d, Lyra2, and Yescrypt), and one that is
cache-timing attack resistant (either Catena or Argon2i).  We could
recommend the cache-timing resistant algorithm for algorithms running on
VMs which may also be running an attacker's code, and the unpredictable
algorithm for full-disk encryption, dedicated authentication servers, and
other cases where cache-timing attacks are not likely.
