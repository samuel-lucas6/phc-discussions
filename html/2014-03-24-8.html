&gt; &gt; I've pushed code to a public repository for the candidate I will be
&gt; &gt; submitting, pufferfish. This repository will be frantically updated
&gt; over
&gt; &gt; the coming week as I prepare my submission, but I wanted to get some
&gt; &gt; initial feedback before the cutoff.

&gt; I fixed a few bugs for you. I keep forgetting the correct way to do a
&gt; pull
&gt; request  from the web interface on GitHub. So you might have gotten a
&gt; few  emails  about  that :)

Thanks for the pull requests!


&gt; &gt; The dynamic s-boxes are of course the biggest differentiating factor
&gt; &gt; between pufferfish and blowfish. The s-box generation is as follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Hash the raw salt as sha512
&gt; &gt; 2. hmac-sha512 the password using the hashed salt as the key
&gt; &gt; 3. hmac-sha512 the password again, using the output of the hmac
&gt; &gt; operation in step 2 as the key
&gt; &gt; 4. These two hmac hashes are concatenated to initialize the 1024-bit
&gt; state
&gt; &gt; 5. The four s-boxes are each filled with m_cost / 4 / sizeof (uint64_t)
&gt; &gt; words by iterating over the internal state with a variant of chacha8
&gt;  
&gt; You might want to pick SHA512 or ChaCha8 to lower the complexity.

This is something I will consider.


&gt; &gt; I elected to use this design because I really like bcrypt, and I really
&gt; &gt; like the idea of being memory hard while using as little memory as
&gt; &gt; possible. And I believe that the modifications I have made increase the
&gt; &gt; effectiveness and extend the longevity of the original bcrypt design.
&gt;
&gt; I was hoping someone would make bcrypt more memory hard. I was
&gt; wondering  how did you come up with the rotation amounts: 22, 33, 53,
&gt; and  61?

Experimentation, trial and error. I spent a lot of time on it, examining
the access patterns and frequencies. I picked the top four numbers that
had the highest dispersion in my testing. Granted, I'm not a
mathemetician, so this was an area I was hoping that you especially
would be able to provide guidance in.


&gt; P.S. I actually wrote one just in case no one else did. And I really like
&gt; yours .

Thank you for this comment :)


&gt; I  was thinking of doing 64 bit by doing 4 calls of "F" instead of 2
&gt; per  round, but  I left it as 32 bit. R otating might be  just as good
&gt; . The
&gt; main  difference I did was a  variable amount of fixed  sized sboxes vs
&gt; fixed amount of  variable sized  sboxes. Each call to "F"  I use the
&gt; next 4
&gt; sboxes and I messed  with the round counts. The first pass I do 1 round,
&gt; second pass 2 rounds, third 3... Minimum is 5 passes so this would be
&gt; kind of like 15 round blowfish. t_cost increases the number of passes.
&gt; So  basically I  turned  blowfish into a more than  likely non-
&gt; cryptographic
&gt; function.

The first version I wrote early last year used a variable amount of
fixed-sized s-boxes as well, but I gave it more thought and decided that
a fixed number of arbitrarily-sized s-boxes was a better approach. I
also considered doubling the number of calls to the F-function as well,
but I was afraid this would make the algorithm too "heavy" since the
number of calls to encipher are already increased with larger s-boxes. I
would be interested in collaborating on this with you before the dealine
though if you'd like to share your code with me.
