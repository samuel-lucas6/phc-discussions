Subject: Ideas for password hashing from a non-expert

I'd like to know if it is worthwhile for me to enter an algorithm to this
competition.  The algorithm I have so far is motivated from scrypt, with
following goals for improvements for weaknesses I believe I see:

- Improve the matching of the algorithm to real desktop computers to make
it harder to cost-reduce in custom hardware.  This would be done by taking
modern DRAM/cache and multiple cores into account.
- Provide an option for better deniability, by having a default hashing
scheme that requires no hashing parameters to be saved with the salt.
- Support an adjustable combination of both client and server key
stretching.

DRAM memory interfaces, and multiple CPU cores would be kept busy at near
full efficiency.  I've not built a multi-thread version yet, but I'm
thinking one thread which sleeps most of the time due to cache misses would
load data from memory one cache-miss worth of data at a time, while N other
threads hash the cached data, never causing a cache miss.   Each core
should run at close to full speed in parallel.

Deniability is a big issue for the TrueCrypt application.  Storing salt is
fine, because it is indistinguishable from random data.  Scrypt actually
stores the word "scrypt" in the saved hashed password, making it unsuitable
for TrueCrypt.  My non-parameterized KDF would assume the weakest compute
setting, test the password, and if it fails increase to the next level,
until the "current" maximum supported by TrueCrypt is reached, or until
there is not enough memory for the next level.  Similarly, memory would be
increased along with compute power, on a fixed schedule, not a factor of 2
each time.  Since each level is twice the computation, this only slows down
the algorithm by 2X, and if the TrueCrypt user doesn't care about
deniability (the typical case), the successful hashing parameters could be
cached along with the encrypted volume file location which is already
cached unless the user disables it.  Users could select the level of
difficulty, but by default TrueCrypt could just run the hash for the
default length of time desired, like 1-ish seconds, and auto-select a
reasonable default key stretching level for the user.

In client/server applications, the KDF would optionally be split between
the client and server.  Some clients are slow (javascript, low-end
smart-phones), and some servers can't handle the load of long key
stretching and would rather offload it to clients.  This also means both
the client and server have to be compromised to compromise the derived key,
allowing users to verify client code, and server admins to verify server
code, hopefully keeping both happy while ending the debate over server vs
client side KDFs.  If you guys really want to continue that debate, and
don't what to split the load, I'll throw my vote in for client side KDF.

Currently, I just fill memory with ARC4 data, and then use the user's key
to do a random walk through memory, hashing one cache-miss of data at a
time.  It's super-simple, and I'm not sure how to improve over ARC4, which
I believe will typically be limited by DRAM write speed.  Is there a need
for a better RNG than ARC4?  Given that we're hashing based on the password
and a large NONCE, the only reason to fill memory with random-ish data is
so that we actually have to load the data from memory to compute the hash.
 If it were something simple, like a counter filling memory, we could just
compute it on the fly instead.  ARC4 has flaws such as long-term
correlations, but I do not believe anyone knows a shortcut for computing
what is at position X in the stream that is faster than a cache miss (often
around 40-80 cycles).  However, I also use ARC4 for determining the next
"page" to load, and how each core hashes the page of data.  Should I use
another RNG to generate page addresses and how to hash each page, or is
plain old ARC4 good enough?  I like that ARC4 isn't as highly accelerated
in custom hardware, and that it requires fast access to 256 bytes of
memory, so compared to SHA-256 it does not cost-reduce nearly as much in a
custom ASIC.

Sorry I am not up to speed on this competition, nor am I a crypto expert.
 I do understand what slows down code, however, so making parallel use of
available resources is something I'm comfortable with.  Would you guys
suggest I continue with this code and provide a submission?  What changes
should I make if I do?

Thanks,
Bill
