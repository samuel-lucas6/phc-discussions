Hi, Alexander.

I'm trying to keep it short this time :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a difference, though: I guess yescrypt's pwxform S-box lookups

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, there is no table look-up or anything of the sort in any Blake
&gt;&gt; variant I'm aware of.
&gt;
&gt; Of course not in Blake2, but does Lyra2 itself perform anything like it?
&gt;

The most similar feature I can see in Lyra2 is on the line of Gregory
Maxwell's point on "making more use of the total available hardware",
referring to caches: right after we write on a given row, in the next
iteration we pseudorandomly read from its columns (taking advantage of
the fact that it should still be in cache, so attackers are motivated to
do have a similar-sized cache line). This is similar to having a LUT of
the size of a row.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; There is, however, another situation that involves only small amounts of
&gt;&gt; memory and, thus, in which attackers can benefit from faster memory
&gt;&gt; technology: recomputations during a TMTO attack. After all, whether the
&gt;&gt; scheme/pass is deterministic or password dependent, recomputations
&gt;&gt; become password-independent as long as the attacker stores the sequence
&gt;&gt; of rows required after seeing them in original computation; those rows
&gt;&gt; can, thus, be prefetched and stored in cache-like memory. As a result,
&gt;&gt; while the original computation of a block V_i (discarded) from a set of
&gt;&gt; blocks \phi{V_i} took, say, 20\sigma (where \sigma accounts both for
&gt;&gt; memory- and processing-related costs), a hardware acceleration of 10x
&gt;&gt; combined with a 10x faster memory could bring the cost of recomputations
&gt;&gt; to approximately 1 if \sigma is 50% memory and 50% processing;
&gt;&gt; parallelism and pipelining, if possible, may allow recomputations to
&gt;&gt; occur even faster. The lesson here is that, even though at first sight
&gt;&gt; the time*memory cost would appear to the around 20, in practice it might
&gt;&gt; be much lower than that. That is why computing the actual time*memory
&gt;&gt; cost is tricky, especially without experiments to verify them, and why I
&gt;&gt; believe TMTO resistance should involve a reasonable security margin
&gt;&gt; (something that Argon and Lyra2, for example, try to achieve with their
&gt;&gt; minimum settings).
&gt;
&gt; Basically, you're saying that TMTO reduces not only the memory
&gt; component, but also a time component - specifically, memory latency - so
&gt; the theoretical memory*time calculations that assume same time per round
&gt; of a primitive, etc. do not reflect the reality.  OK, this is finally a
&gt; well-reasoned argument in favor of a TMTO security margin.  (It's also
&gt; an argument in favor of compute time hardening, which makes having a
&gt; TMTO security margin less important.)

Actually, since we are talking about "security margins", I believe it is
an argument in favor of both approaches: they clearly have value in
combination, so if an attacker can somehow explore one but not the
other, then we are still safe.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - For 1 thread ("p1") with different passes through memory: say,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yescrypt with T=0 does 4/3 passes though memory with 12 MUL+ADD+XOR,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while Lyra2 with T=1 and BlaMka makes 2 passes through memory with 8
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MUL+ADD+XOR are comparable (?) in terms of compute-time latency (4/3*12
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; = 2*8 = 16). Lyra2 in this case is slightly (3%) slower. Given the low
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difference, the reason is probably related to bandwidth usage, because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lyra2 purposely uses more bandwidth in this scenario: namely, it
makes 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writes per call of the underlying hash instead of 1, and 4 reads (2
from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cache and 2 from memory) instead of 2. I'm not sure if that is good or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bad, but improvements on memory bandwidth are usually slower than on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; computation power, so I would rather say it is good in terms of attack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resistance, as it limits an attacker's parallelism ability.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes sense, but you also need to factor in yescrypt's S-box
lookups.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I agree this factor is likely to play a role. However, Bill reported a
&gt;&gt; long time ago speed-ups of ~20% if Lyra2 reduced its number of memory
&gt;&gt; writes when no parallelism is employed. We preferred not do so in the
&gt;&gt; 1-threaded version, however, because we _wanted_ attackers to run into
&gt;&gt; memory bounds as soon as possible (again, because users and attackers
&gt;&gt; are likely to have access to the same memory technology).
&gt;
&gt; I didn't mean that yescrypt's S-box lookups slow it down a lot - I think
&gt; they slow it down just a bit.  This is a measurable slowdown, though.
&gt; (I designed and re-designed pwxform until the performance impact of
&gt; S-box lookups was low, while their frequency was bcrypt-like.)
&gt;
&gt; I primarily meant that they add to defense too, so same speed of Lyra2
&gt; and yescrypt on a given benchmark may actually mean that yescrypt wins
&gt; in terms of the compute hardening against various platforms.

That is possible, but I prefer to discuss such issues after performing
actual experiments (not exactly to "defend Lyra2" or any other scheme,
but rather to understand their limits: the topic is very interesting for
further research :) ).

&gt;&gt; BTW, we have not yet used the suggestion by Samuel Neves regarding NORX
&gt;&gt; tricks ("We used this trick (replacing + with ^, * with &amp;) in NORX (pg.
&gt;&gt; 23 of <a href="https://norx.io/data/norx.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://norx.io/data/norx.pdf</a>); it does noticeably
&gt;&gt; improve latency."). We will try and see what happens.
&gt;
&gt; I think Samuel was referring to the operation re-ordering trick I had
&gt; mentioned, not to "replacing + with ^, * with &amp;".  Replacing * with &amp;
&gt; would obviously remove the multiply latency hardening.
&gt;

Yes, I understood that: I was just quoting his exact phrase to remind
the context. I meant that we will try a similar trick with ADDs and MULs.
