Subject: tunable SIMD and instruction-level parallelism

Bill, all -

Attached is a standalone program I wrote a while ago to test these ideas:

1. Having SIMD and instruction-level parallelism tunable.  We may have a
generic implementation that does not (fully) use the parallelism, as
well as optimized implementations for certain combinations (or ranges)
of values of these parameters.  This allows us to use future CPUs' wider
SIMD vectors, etc. while keeping our hashes compatible with older
implementations, including running on older CPUs.  In this program, I
use #define's, but they may as well be variables.

2. Separate SIMD lanes ("#define SIMD 4" here) along with separate
interleaved instruction streams ("#define P 4"), with their inputs
and/or outputs intermixed before and/or after each block.

This differs from scrypt's BlockMix where the mixing occurs throughout
the block, but which limits the available SIMD*P width to at most
512-bit (as long as Salsa20 is used for the mixing like in scrypt).

The mixing once per block is needed since otherwise it becomes possible
to compute the whole heavy part of the KDF as a few sequential portions,
one per lane, with the memory needs reduced accordingly (it'll be
number-of-lanes times smaller).  (This is similar to how scrypt's p&gt;1
allows for computation with less memory when the parallelism is not
fully made use of as such.)

For this purpose, as well as to produce a random index when needed,
mixing at end of block works best.

Mixing at beginning of block may be used when that time would be wasted
waiting for data (TLB miss, then memory latency), although alternatively
the next random index may be produced a few sub-blocks earlier (but not
too early).  (In my testing, the needed before-block delay is roughly
equivalent to Salsa20/4 on a CPU.  So maybe we can simply have Salsa20/4
before and after each block, although when SIMD*P is greater than
512-bit a single Salsa20 becomes insufficient and thus the delay from
multiple crypto hash invocations becomes larger than is necessary to
hide the TLB miss + memory latency.)

I think it is sufficient that we mix the lanes once or twice per block.
I'd appreciate any comments on this.

3. Blowfish-like variable S-boxes accessed from within the BlockMix
substitute.

4. Reuse of the most recently written blocks for the S-boxes (it's data
that is likely still in L1 cache anyway).

5. When BlockMix is used for memory filling, like in SMix's first loop,
the S-boxes may slide onto data already written by the currently running
BlockMix.

6. And yes, in this experiment I have abandoned scrypt BlockMix's
shuffling of output sub-blocks, which I think was not justified (or was
redundant given other data dependencies and high Salsa20 block size):

<a href="http://mail.tarsnap.com/scrypt/msg00059.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.tarsnap.com/scrypt/msg00059.html</a>

It looks like none of the scrypt-inspired PHC candidates discussed so
far have retained this shuffling.  (Well, we did in non-experimental
escrypt so far, but it is unlikely to stay for long.)
