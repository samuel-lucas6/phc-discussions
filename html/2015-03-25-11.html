The default number of threads in Lyra2's PHC call is 2.  Did you modify it
to one?

&gt; &gt; OK, I am trying to avoid these test to be presented as a performance

&gt; &gt; because with reference implementations it would be unfair.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, there is already lscpu for both platforms in git

&gt; &gt; (This is quite a big machine, actually running Fedora for some Red Hat
&gt; &gt; distro development I have access to)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The charts showing real memory usage and real time vs. the cost
&gt; &gt; &gt; parameter values might be useful, but it would also be useful to see a
&gt; &gt; &gt; cross-chart of real memory usage vs. real time (with the lowest time
&gt; cost
&gt; &gt; &gt; setting supported by each scheme) and with growing memory cost setting
&gt; &gt; &gt; (this is how you'd control the real time).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Isn't it what Figure 1 already shows?
&gt;
&gt; No.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Or you mean some combination?
&gt;
&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; (tcost is minimal for each candidate there, memory cost is increasing
&gt; and chart
&gt; &gt; shows real memory use + real run time).
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but the x-axis is in different units for different candidates.  I'd
&gt; like a chart combining the data for y-axes from these two charts, using
&gt; one of these on the new chart's x-axis and the other on y-axis.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lyra2 is surprisingly fast.  That's nice.  Your table does not give
&gt; &gt; &gt; exact numbers for candidates meeting your requirements, though - maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can add that (for their lowest supported t_cost)?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For the last KDF test the exact input parameters are in Table 5, times
&gt; &gt; are in log directory. For example with the minimal t_cost:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/m_kdf/lyra2.dat" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/m_kdf/lyra2.dat</a>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/m_kdf/lyra2-sse.dat" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/m_kdf/lyra2-sse.dat</a>
&gt;
&gt; So it's 515 ms for the SIMD-enabled Lyra2 to reach 1 GB.  Including
&gt; memory (de)allocation overhead, right?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I did not want to modify default internal configurations (and I think it
&gt; &gt; should not be even needed. Give users some knobs and they'll find
&gt; insecure
&gt; &gt; combination and will use it as the default... well, joking :-)
&gt;
&gt; This is always a concern, yes.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Why I do not use multiple threads is based on disk-encryption my use
&gt; case:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In general, FDE-enabled disk can be moved between several machines with
&gt; &gt; completely different performance and hardware configurations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On slow machine unlocking should take more time and it would be
&gt; &gt; probably acceptable (in some reasonable limits).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But if it cannot be unlocked at all (cannot run parallel threads) it is
&gt; &gt; unacceptable for the user (usability fail). Security/usability
&gt; tradeoff...
&gt;
&gt; No, this particular tradeoff does not exist.  You can always run the
&gt; would-be-threads sequentially (or switch between them).  e.g. I've been
&gt; testing yescrypt with p=41 on a machine with 8 logical CPUs, running
&gt; only 8 threads at a time.  In the current submitted yescrypt code,
&gt; OpenMP takes care of that.  Or you can simply build without
&gt; multi-threading support (neither OpenMP nor anything else) and still be
&gt; able to compute a p &gt; 1 derived key, just slower as you say.
&gt;
&gt; The real tradeoff is that excessive parallelism weakens security: the
&gt; attacker might need less memory (presumably expensive) per compute core
&gt; (presumably cheap).  For this reason, maybe yescrypt's default pwxform
&gt; rounds count isn't best for your use case.  It works better for user
&gt; authentication where the parallelism comes from concurrent requests
&gt; anyway.  There's another reason for the 6 rounds, though - this achieves
&gt; bcrypt-like rate of S-box lookups, needed to ensure bcrypt-like GPU
&gt; attack resistance.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The second reason is that it can could run in a very limited environment
&gt; &gt; (a bootloader for full system encryption) where threads are not easily
&gt; manageable.
&gt;
&gt; So you can run a thread-less build.  No problem there.  You just need to
&gt; provide the memory...
&gt;
&gt; ...Speaking of which: this is where a security/usability tradeoff
&gt; actually exists.  If you use e.g. Lyra2 or YESCRYPT_RW and require 1 GB,
&gt; you'd have a really hard time computing on a machine with less RAM than
&gt; that since we're deliberately discouraging TMTO attacks (and thus
&gt; legitimate uses as well).  Classic scrypt and YESCRYPT_WORM solve
&gt; this, at the expense of lower area-time product and TMTO-friendliness
&gt; for attackers as well.  (I think there is not yet a defender-friendly
&gt; implementation of classic scrypt, nor YESCRYPT_WORM, for uses on lower
&gt; memory machines.  But it's just a matter of implementation.  This can be
&gt; implemented easily when the need arises.)  &lt;plug&gt;I think yescrypt is the
&gt; only entry in this competition that retained this flexibility.&lt;/plug&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, the security impact of YESCRYPT_WORM (vs. _RW) is very
&gt; significant.  It's almost the same as going back to classic scrypt,
&gt; with only minor tweaks added (such as the garbage collector attack
&gt; resistance I mentioned earlier today).  (In part, this is deliberate: to
&gt; ease implementation of YESCRYPT_WORM by slightly revising existing
&gt; implementations of classic scrypt.)
