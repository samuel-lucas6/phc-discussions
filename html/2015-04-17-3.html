&gt; &gt; &gt;2) The submissions evolve over the competition period significantly,
&gt; &gt; &gt;absorbing new ideas and constructions from the discussion, possibly even
&gt; &gt; &gt;merging with each other. The confidence in the winner(s) comes from the
&gt; &gt; &gt;consensus in the committee on certain features that are gradually
&gt; integrated
&gt; &gt; &gt;in the final version.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's the approach I prefer (see my earlier thoughts about allowing a
&gt; final
&gt; &gt; round of updates for the top three, before a single best-of-breed is
&gt; chosen).
&gt;
&gt; I think we might want to specifically encourage collaborative work.
&gt;
&gt; For example, it should be easy for Argon2 to adopt Lyra2's BlaMKa and
&gt; make this the standard mode (whereas in Lyra2 it's an option), but it
&gt; might be better for Argon2d to adopt yescrypt's pwxform (not for
&gt; Argon2i, because pwxform makes data-dependent S-box lookups).
&gt;

Excellent idea, IMO.  I would prefer to have an additional phase - an
upgrade phase _after_ winner(s) are selected, where winning author(s) are
asked to be open to improvements from others.

I still see room for improvement in Lyra2's password-independent phase and
potential for better GPU resistance, and I would like to have a t_cost
option that lowers it's minimum I/O operations per memory location.  Argon2
needs it's parallelism more under control, and we need a stripped-down
version of Yescrypt that is easy to understand and deploy.  POMELO might
need a well proven cryptographic hash applied at the end if we can't prove
it's security otherwise.  Several ideas from Catena could be used to build
a secure password hashing framework, which could include encoding/decoding
of parameters from strings, similar to what Pufferfish has.

&gt; Argon2 is such an obvious improvement, it seems odd to keep it out so
&gt; that the
&gt; &gt; decision has to be made on a previous-generation version.  Or, more
&gt; &gt; worryingly, that the decision on Argon might be made on the assumption
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; what'll be adopted is actually Argon2, blurring the line over what's
&gt; being
&gt; &gt; decided on.
&gt;
&gt; Agreed.
&gt;
&gt; Alexander


If anyone should feel allowing Argon2 as a finalist is unfair, it should be
me.  Argon2 is good, but not as strong as my TwoCats, IMO.

However, the product of this competition is not fairness - it's password
hashing algorithms.  I feel this process will be improved by allowing
Argon2.  I do not think it will be improved by revisiting the somewhat
painful selection of finalists.  So, I say let Argon2 in, and continue the
competition!
