Hash: SHA1

As promised, though a bit late, here is my review of Lanarea.

While the code is beautifully written, it fails badly at protecting
passwords.  Lanarea can be sped up in an ASIC attack per core by
approximately the expected speed-up of Blake2b, somewhere on the order
of 10X-ish.  Lanarea is so slow that most use cases for Lanarea would
fit hashing memory into L1 cache, allowing very many copies to be
implemented on a single ASIC.  An ASIC attacker would gain both a high
compute time advantage and parallel computation advantage.  Overall
ASIC resistance seems to be lower than for bcrypt.

Lanarea runtime is O(m_cost^2*t_cost), and over 99% of the runtime is
due to full memory Blake2b computations.  As a result, realistic
hashing sizes for Lanarea

32KiB benchmark
- ---------------

PHC&gt; time ./phs-lanarea 1 128
Allocating matrix of size 2048x16 = 32768
Initializing matrix
Processing t_cost loop 0
Processing t_cost loop 1
Processing t_cost loop 2
Processing t_cost loop 3
Setting output

d9 04 54 1d 15 05 6c ad
b5 9b 85 a8 8c e1 c4 97
a9 21 9c 88 aa 14 78 76
91 8f c5 6d b9 11 41 3a      32 (octets)


real	0m0.607s
user	0m0.607s
sys	0m0.000s

Note that this is with minimum t_cost = 1, and only 16KiB of memory!
It stil takes 0.6 seconds!  It also fits in L1 cache, so there were no
cache misses in this benchmark.

256KiB benchmark
- ----------------

PHC&gt; time ./phs-lanarea 1 1024
Allocating matrix of size 16384x16 = 262144
Initializing matrix
Processing t_cost loop 0
Processing t_cost loop 1
Processing t_cost loop 2
Processing t_cost loop 3

f4 46 a3 1d 13 51 74 38
f1 84 24 81 28 6c 93 7f      32 (octets)


real	0m37.626s
user	0m37.636s
sys	0m0.000s


This is only 256KiB, which fits in my L2 cache, yet it takes 37
seconds!  It is not practical to consider even memory of this tiny for
actual password hashing.  Users will not be patient enough.

Slowing down Lanarea seems to have been a primary goal.  For example,
memory initialization is about 100X slower than the next slowest
entry.  Per byte initialized, Lanarea calls the full Blake2b on 288
bytes.  This can be sped up in an optimized version by feeding the 256
bytes from digits of pi and e in first, and then doing a Blake2b on
the remaining 32-byte hash to produce a new 32-byte output hash.
However, only one of those bytes is used for memory initialization.  A
trivial 64X speedup with no loss of security would be to use all 64
bytes of Blake2b output, rather than just 1.

Memory initialization is very fast compared to the t_cost rounds.  For
every 16 bytes of memory hashed in the Lanarea t_cost loop, *all* of
memory is re-hashed by the full Blake2b.  There's comments in the
paper and code about causing cache misses, but the reality is that
Lanarea code runs &lt; 1% of the total time compared to Blake2b.

There was a comment in the code about causing cache misses.  I thought
this was a mistake, because the address is at most 8KiB forward in
memory from the current position, and an attacker could just pre-load
the next 8KiB into cache.  However, since *all* memory is re-hashed
with Blake2b after every 16 bytes, it is true that only the most
recent memory will be in cache, and this likely would cause cache
misses.  However, these 16 L1 cache misses will not take enough time
to count compared to hashing all of memory with full Blake2b.

I have a lot of other concerns about Lanarea, but I should move onto
the next review.  Here are some of my notes:

- - r is at most 255 larger than y, and since rows are only 16 bytes,
that's only 4KiB at most.  This is unlikely to cause even an L1 cache
miss, while the code says it is designed to cause cache misses
- - there are two 1-byte unpredictable reads per inner loop, which might
provide some GPU resistance, if it weren't for the rehashing of all
memory every 16 bytes.
- - m_cost gets multiplied by rowSize so it is just matrixSize.  Using
m_cost instead of matrixSize is confusing in some places.
- - Care seems to be taken to present the matrix data to blake2b for
hashing in each inner loop in a diagonal pattern.  However, it wont
make any improvement in security, and should be left out.
- - It has the typical input collisions due to Blake2b XORing onto their
state.  Additional trailing 0's sometimes don't result in a different
hash.
- - Why run the loop multiples of 4 times times t_cost?  Isn't it
already slow enough?
- - output loop runs in (outlen/32)*matrixsize time - very slow, but
nothing compared to the main loop

Lanarea needs a lot of work.  I think hashing all of memory with
Blake2b every 16 bytes is a bug.  When fixed in the most obvious way
(move Blake2b hashing to the next outer loop), then Lanarea will
suffer from a massive TMTO attack, very similar to the one against
Schvrch.

Lanarea does not make it on my list of algorithms I wish to see in the
second round.
