Dear Stefan,

Thank you so much for the reply.

I just explained in other two mails regarding how the 2nd round and final
round candidates of SHA-3 were selected in scientific ways based on facts
found in the SHA-3 zoo and eBASH, etc.

I hope that my explanation might be an answer to you.
Also, please let me know if there is any comment on that.

&gt;  Let me share the process of SHA-3 selection.

&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Till 5 were chosen, NIST focused only on evaluating each algorithm based
&gt;&gt; on security, software and hardware performance based on clear comparison.
&gt;&gt; Till 5 were chosen, NIST never considered additional features such as
&gt;&gt; elegance and simplicity, etc. So, at least, we sure that the five
&gt;&gt; algorithms sound fine in terms of security and performance.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As I understand your complaint, you argue that the SHA-3 process, at least
&gt; the down from 51 to 14, and the narrowing down from 14 to 5 candidates, has
&gt; been based on objective and verifiable comparisons regarding security and
&gt; performance? Or, as you put it in another mail, "the criteria of standards
&gt; or algorithms related to the security of system should be able to be
&gt; measured by scientific ways"?
&gt;
&gt; Having been on the submitters side in SHA-3, this is not what I see when I
&gt; read the SHA-3 reports. Surely, there had been some candidates that where
&gt; actually broken or performed poor everywhere. But most choices where based
&gt; on subjective decisions, not on criteria measurable by scientific ways.
&gt;
&gt; Mind you, I am not accusing you, or the other authors of the report, or
&gt; the NIST in general, of anything wrong. It would actually be completely
&gt; irresponsible to ignore soft "facts" for the decision.
&gt;
&gt; Consider security, the hardest of all criteria. The SHA-3 round-1 report &lt;
&gt; <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/" rel="nofollow">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/</a>
&gt; documents/sha3_NISTIR7620.pdf&gt; says:
&gt;   "NIST considered not only attacks that directly demonstrated that a SHA-
&gt;    3 candidate fell short of NIST’s stated security targets, but also
&gt;    attacks that have historically been precursors to more severe attacks
&gt;    on legacy hash algorithms."
&gt;
&gt; This APPEARS like a rational foundations for decisions, doesn't it?
&gt;
&gt; But it does mean nothing less than some seasoned cryptographer at NIST
&gt; looks at a reported attacks and thinks "oh, this feels bad" or "nice work,
&gt; but I don't think this will go much further". Anticipating the likelihood
&gt; that a reported weakness gets worse cannot be based on hard scientific
&gt; facts. Nevertheless, this is an important part of the decision process.
&gt;
&gt; And if there is no reported weaknesses at all? Then surely the candidate
&gt; must be promoted to the next round, right? Actually, the lack of
&gt; cryptanalysis may be a reason not to promote a candidate either, since it
&gt; indicates either a lack of interest in the candidate from the cryptographic
&gt; community, or it shows that the candidate is difficult to analyse.
&gt;
&gt; This is, what NIST did and what it had to do. And it is, was what we, the
&gt; submitters, actually expected the NIST to do. When writing our submission,
&gt; we expected the SHA-3 contest to be as much a "beauty contest" based on
&gt; soft criteria, as a "demolition derby", based on hard facts -- not much
&gt; different from the AES process.
&gt;
&gt; Please read the SHA-3 first-round report I quoted above. How many specific
&gt; reasons for not selecting a candidate does it give?
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps, the PHC report has been too verbose giving specific reasons for
&gt; not promoting specific candidates?
&gt;
&gt; So long
&gt;
&gt; Stefan
