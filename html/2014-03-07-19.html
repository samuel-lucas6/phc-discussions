&gt; In place of a c == 1 PBKDF2, I would say HKDF, which does not use an iteration count, is preferable in place of PBKDF2 in TigerKDF.  The key advantage is that HKDF-Extract uses the salt as the key, the password as the message for the pre-hashing.  Trailing 0 bytes in the salt are not so much of an issue.  &lt;<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5869.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5869.txt</a>&gt;.

I agree, though I still worry about leaking timing information by
hashing the password as a message.  The hack I just implemented pads
the password and should run in the same-ish time regardless of the
length.  I add the password length as a parameter in info, so I think
that gets around collisions like we see in HMAC.

Is it worthwhile worrying about looping over the password potentially
revealing it's length?  I currently use a "secure_zero" function I
copied from Blake2 to clear the password after I hash it, unless the
user passes a flag saying not to.  That function also loops over the
password, so to make it more secure from a timing point of view, I'll
need to pass a padding parameter to it and have it overwrite the
password over and over until it's written a certain number of bytes.

Even then, the though of a cache-timing attack is worrisome, but I
don't see how that could reveal a password length to better than a
cache line - typically 64 bytes.

&gt; In the CodesInChaos case, I see no reason to add in a PBKDF2 with c == 1, although you could use "purpose" in place of the PBKDF2 salt parameter (or use a combination of purpose and salt).

Yeah, PBKDF2 with c == 1 seems lame when you read the code.  I'll
stick with HKDF for now.

&gt; I think HKDF-Expand has attractive characteristics for expanding keys without compounding the offered iteration count, and that would be particularly apt if you ran a non-trivial iterative PBKDF2 with the same HMAC as the HKDF parts and the required output size to have a PRK for HKDF-Extract.
&gt;
&gt;  - Dennis
&gt;
&gt; Aside: I think it would be useful for the HKDF "info"/"purpose" parameter to be part of HKDF-Extract too.  Something like HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM || info) -&gt; PRK.

I was surprised that the info parameter is hashed in while expanding
rather than in extract.  It doesn't matter in my application because I
do both at the same time, but if I wanted to run a long-runtime
memory-hard KDF in the middle, it would be annoying to have to keep
potentially sensitive data in memory until after it completed.  Also,
if info is very long, I'd hate to have to re-hash it on every output
block.

Other than that, the HKDF expand loop looks good to me.

&gt; PS: Bill, I still think you have the password-length condition backwards.  When the password is LONGER than think hash-function's block size, it is pre-hashed in HMAC.  It is not pre-hashed for password text not larger than a hash-function block.  But this is solved in HKDF since it is pointless for a salt to be larger than a hash-function block and when the salts used are all the same length anyhow.  I also think that practical but generously-large values of an iteration count will successfully hide the timing of HKDF-Extract in any case.

I originally used a 2000 iteration count in PBKDF2, and I hated giving
it up, partly because it would insure my KDF were at least as secure
as the somewhat standard application of 2000 rounds of PBKDF2-SHA-256.
 However, I need every millisecond for memory hashing, and what I did
was set c == 1, and spend the saved time hashing some early memory,
and then overwriting it, so that if memory is leaked later on, an
attacker still has to do some work before he can detect an incorrect
password guess.  The scariest part about memory-hard KDFs to me is
having some of that password dependent memory leaking somehow.  For
example, I can call mmap and request un-swappable memory, but if my
KDF is running on a virtual machine and someone takes a live snapshot,
forget it.
