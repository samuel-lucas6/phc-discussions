Subject: Re: [PHC] Design Rationale and Security Analysis of PHC candidates

OK, it is rather a matter of semantics then :)

OTOH, I may be shooting myself in the foot here, but I'm not sure the
attack you describe is actually better than what we (partially)
describe. More precisely (and I may very well have misunderstood
something from your slides): in Lemma 1, we describe an attack with no
penalty during the Setup phase when the memory usage is 1/2, while in
your case the attack penalty is described as "1.5" in (which I assume
means "50% slower") in slide 48. Did I miss something?

For the Wandering phase, we indeed consider a scenario with 50% of the
memory usage to show how badly the strategy being discussed ("store
ahead") scales. Now that I think about it, that was misleading, since it
was never intended as a through analysis for such 50% memory usage.
Anyhow, that was our fault, so you do have the right to say that your
attack is better than what we provided in the documentation.

Anyway, again: that was a great analysis and we are taking those
considerations into account in our own trade-off discussion. I believe
it should be placed into a context were the speed is also taken into
account, though, since if the user is willing to spend ~3.5 seconds
doing the password hashing (the time obtained by Bill in his benchmarks
for Argon), for example, then he/she would prefer using T around 5,
which, by design, leads to a much higher TMTO defense.

BR,

Marcos.

&gt; Hi Marcos,
&gt; 
&gt; thank you for the response!
&gt; 
&gt; my understanding was that page 22 and Section 5.1.3 in
&gt; <a href="https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/Lyra2-v1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/Lyra2-v1.pdf</a> contain some
&gt; analysis of using less memory than intended. In particular, you describe
&gt; how to use 1/2 of memory in the Setup phase (page 22) and in the Wandering
&gt; phase (page 25).
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe wording "claims" was too strong in my document, it would be better to
&gt; say that there exist third-party results more efficient than the original
&gt; analysis.
&gt; 
&gt; I did not look into tweaks intentionally, I'd prefer to wait till they are
&gt; approved by the committee.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; Dmitry

&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure whether "attacked" applies to the 'Tradeoff analysis" of
&gt;&gt; Lyra2: originally there were no claims on attacks involving half of the
&gt;&gt; memory usage, but only against a very low memory usage.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We do have such claims in the new version to be submitted (assuming
&gt;&gt; Lyra2 moves to the phase in which such tweaks are allowed), and the
&gt;&gt; attack venue described does not seem to be effective in that case.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, the "FPGA/ASIC defense" does not take into account all tweaks
&gt;&gt; described in the documentation, although I agree with "attacked" if you
&gt;&gt; consider only the basic design and ignores this part of the document.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyhow, very interesting analysis!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BR,

&gt;&gt;&gt; and weaknesses of the candidates.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; We are welcome to any feedback. We plan to add further information to the
