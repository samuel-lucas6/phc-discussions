&gt; Grammar fail. That should read "Solar observed that it was possible

&gt;&gt;&gt; In this case, each ASIC would split up it's portion of the ROM into
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4096 1MiB "chunk areas" in external DRAM.  It would also store up to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4GiB/64 = 64Mi password scratchpads, each representing a password
&gt;&gt;&gt; guess in progress.  As it loads it's 4096 chunk areas sequentially,
&gt;&gt;&gt; over and over, it computes all the workunit updates with as much
&gt;&gt;&gt; parallelism as the ASIC can support, maybe 100-ish or even 1000-ish
&gt;&gt;&gt; AESENC cores, pipelined maybe 6 deep.  That would be 600-ish to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6000-ish AESENC executed in parallel per ASIC, or around 150K to 1.5M
&gt;&gt;&gt; in total, applying AES-128 hashing to all of it's 512-bit scratchpads
&gt;&gt;&gt; that are waiting on that specific chunk area to be applied.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This attack seems to be exploiting the grid-aligned structure of
&gt;&gt; EARWORM's arena, in which chunks begin at discrete 1MiB boundaries.
&gt;&gt; There was another thread here in which Solar observed that to split
&gt;&gt; the arena into W=4 sections, and divide it across multiple machines,
&gt;&gt; each of which needs only the first section and one other.  I suggested
&gt;&gt; then that you could prevent this by collapsing the arena's three
&gt;&gt; dimensions into one and making possible for chunks to begin at any
&gt;&gt; point along that dimension.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So instead of
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; for l from 0 to L-1
&gt;&gt;     for w from 0 to W-1
&gt;&gt;         scratchpad[w] = AESRound(arena[index][l][w], scratchpad[w])
&gt;&gt; index = scratchpad[0] mod 2**m_cost
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; we'd have
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; for l from 0 to L-1
&gt;&gt;     for w from 0 to W-1
&gt;&gt;         scratchpad[w] = AESRound(arena[index++], scratchpad[w])
&gt;&gt; index = scratchpad[0] mod (2**mcost * L * W)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; and add one extra chunk to the arena (for a size of (2**m_cost + 1) *
&gt;&gt; L * W blocks) so that this doesn't overflow.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I didn't make this change because I didn't view Solar's attack as a
&gt;&gt; threat within my model. This one, however, is a horse of a different
&gt;&gt; color. It seems that the same change would make your attack much more
&gt;&gt; expensive, because if you can't partition the ROM into discrete chunk
&gt;&gt; areas, then the routing complexity increases enormously. Do I have that
&gt;&gt; correct?

This would complicate the attacker's job, but it wouldn't slow down
the resulting machine much.  Just as you add an extra 1MiB at the end
so you don't have to worry about overflowing memory, each node would
just add one more work area at the end of their memory.  Since each
node has multiple GiB, adding one more MiB is no biggie, though it's
inconvienient (for example, memory comes in nice 2^n sizes, not 2^n +
1 sizes).

The hashes all being in lock-step is nice for the attacker, but each
hash then just has to wait until the memory it needs is finally
available, and they all start when they're ready.  This does take
quite a bit more control logic and would slow it down, but it's less
than 2X-ish, I think.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One reasonable defense against this attack would be to do memory-hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; writes as well as reads, to maybe a few MiB per password hash.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt; would cause my evil machine to need maybe 1000X more memory than I
&gt;&gt;&gt; described, memory bandwidth would likely become the bottleneck, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the hypercube communication network might get overloaded.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This would be a much more substantial change. The resulting design
&gt;&gt; would look more like yescrypt than like the current version of
&gt;&gt; EARWORM. I'm not going to go there, and I wouldn't expect the panel to
&gt;&gt; let me get away with it if I tried.

You're not the first author to feel it would be too much like Solar
Designer's work to make a nice improvement.  My TwoCats is more his
than mine at this point.  However, I have no shame :-)

EARWORM is well differentiated from yescript, IMO.  It is a slimmer
simpler special purpose tool.  The reliance on AESENC instructions and
the super fast read-only hashing sets it apart.  My theoretical attack
boarders on a banana attack, but I think it's worth keeping in mind.
I wouldn't make the change you're suggesting in response to it.  I
really do like EARWORM the way it is.

I love to consider custom ASIC attacks.  Chip architectures is kind of
my thing.  However, ASIC attacks are becoming more expensive all the
time.  Fewer and fewer attackers can afford the latest and greatest
custom silicon.
