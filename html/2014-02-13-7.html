Right, although Samuel Neves posted nice emulation of it via SSE2 in:

&gt; The single-thread results dropped from 0.76 seconds to hash 2GB to 0.4
&gt; seconds.  With two threads, it takes 0.3 seconds, so pretty darned
&gt; fast.  The down-side here is the chains of multiplications are all cut
&gt; to 1/4th the length, while I only got a 1.9X increase in speed.  That
&gt; means an attacker will complete the hash a 4X faster, while I
&gt; completed it only 1.9X faster, if computation speed is the bottleneck.

Yes, and this was deliberate on your part: you knew you were only ~2x
below the memory bandwidth, and you reduced the length of chains to 1/4.
You didn't have to do the latter: you could e.g. access memory every two
rounds (then things will be no worse than before SIMD) or possibly even
every 3 or 4 rounds while still achieving no worse memory bandwidth than
you did pre-SIMD (then you'd have an improvement).  Maybe try it?

Note that accessing memory every N rounds, for N&gt;1, does not reduce the
multiply latency hardening aspect.

&gt; I'm leaning towards abandoning this hack and SIMD all together.

In this form, sure, it's not good enough.  But you can do better.

Also, consider behavior at small memory sizes - e.g., only a few MB per
instance, as will often be the case for password hashing (rather than
for KDF).  You'll get different benchmark results, and the die area
consumed by multipliers may be non-negligible.  In fact, potential reuse
of the multipliers by other (attack) cores could start to matter, so
you'd want to have more parallelism - not only SIMD, but also
interleaving of instructions, keeping almost all pipeline stages of your
multipliers busy on almost all clock cycles.  Your goal is to do that
without reducing multiply latency hardening and without reducing memory
bandwidth usage.  It's not easy, but it may be doable.

On your Ivy Bridge, you need maybe 4x4 = 16 in-flight multiplies per
core, where one x4 factor is SIMD and the other is pipeline stages.
