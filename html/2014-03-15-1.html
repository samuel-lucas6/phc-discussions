&gt; As I mentioned before, I think a shortcut like this could be used for
&gt; more effective memory cost upgrades than what e.g. Catena provides.

I envision the "fast path" to be adequate to situations where there are,
say, several login servers feeding on the same database of hashed
passwords but offering different services, and one of them can be
entrusted with a private key which allows for (much) faster password
verification for some reason, e.g. because it has an HSM while other
frontends do not. Or something like that.

In any case, a fast path can be retrofitted to any password hashing
function by the simple expedient of storing both the hash value AND an
asymmetric encryption of the password (or of SHA-256(password) or
anything similarly fast) with some public key; a system which has a copy
of the private key can forget the hash and use decryption to recover the
password (or its fast hash). Without the private key, the public-key
encrypted password is useless (normal asymmetric encryption algorithms
are randomized, so that cannot be used for enumerating passwords). Such
a scheme implies a storage overhead which needs not be large (with
EC-based ElGamal or ECIES, this could be done with, say, 50 bytes
overhead per stored password).

(I don't follow what you mean by memory cost upgrades in the context
of a "fast path" so I fear we may not be speaking of the same thing.)


Anyway, both the ability to increase the cost parameter from the hash
value alone (without access to the source password), and the "fast
path", are straight from the PHC call for submissions:

  | Ability to transform an existing hash to a different cost setting
  | without knowledge of the password.

and:

  | For example, one may design a scheme that is slow to evaluate
  | except on a server given some server-specific shortcut.

Since these properties were listed as desirable, I kind of assumed that
they were desired.


&gt; &gt; Or even more advanced features such as the ability to
&gt; &gt; delegate computation to an external untrusted system.
&gt; 
&gt; This is an interesting topic, which somehow we haven't touched on this
&gt; list yet, although at least Jeremy Spilman and I thought of it before.
&gt; 
&gt; Arguably, it falls in the same category as hash upgrades and client-side
&gt; pre-hashing, because it can also be implemented on top of an existing
&gt; password hashing scheme lacking this feature as a built-in one

Now I am all ears.

Background: my own candidate (which I submitted three weeks ago) offers
cost parameter increase, a fast path, and delegation. Delegation to an
_untrusted_ external system seems quite non-trivial to me, and I found
only one way to achieve it, which involves some maths. I do not see how
it could be implemented "on top of an existing password hashing scheme".
So if you have a method for that, I am VERY interested.

To avoid any misunderstanding, let me formulate what I mean by
"delegation to an untrusted server".

Let a system S which must compute h(s,p) for a salt value 's', a
password 'p', and a PHS h(). The h() function is configurably slow,
so that leaking h(s,p) to an hostile entity is less problematic (but
you still don't want it to happen if you can avoid it). Anybody
can compute h() (given s and p), there is no secret value in it;
but it is (by construction) expensive.

The system S does not have much (free) computing resources, but can ask
an external system D to compute things for it. However, D is not
trusted: we do not want to give p to D, or even h'(p) for any
deterministic function h'() because this would allow D to, afterwards,
"try passwords" (an offline dictionary attack). D must help us computing
the value, but must not extract any information from what S shows to D
which could allow testing potential passwords. In particular D must
not see h(s,p).

The salt 's' is assumed to be known to everybody. D is modeled as a
passive attacker: D will faithfully run the requested computation (if D
is an active attacker, then it can disrupt the service by simply not
responding, or returning random junk).


If you can describe how such a thing could be built on top of, say,
bcrypt, then please show me.


&gt; &gt; the output is 192 bits only,
&gt; 
&gt; 184, and that's more than enough.

Technically, bcrypt is a custom 64-bit block cipher with a very long key
schedule, which is then used to encrypt a 192-bit input (exactly three
blocks). If it is limited to 184 bits, it is as an artefact of ulterior
encoding (Base64, 31 _characters_ instead of 32, so you really get 186
bits, not 184). If you need more than 128 bits, then that's for a KDF,
and in that case there is no point in applying the Base64 encoding and
its historical shortcomings at all, so you would get the full 192 bits.

Of course, any output can be extended with some KDF, but that's one more
algorithm, extra complexity and so on.


&gt; The actual limit is 72 chars.  56 is an error in the bcrypt paper, and
&gt; it's repeated in the scrypt paper and elsewhere.

Well, the authors of bcrypt specified it as using 56 bytes, so I would
say that the "error" is 72, not 56 -- by definition. Although it can be
argued that the algorithm "works" for longer inputs, one could say that
the "official" bcrypt (with appropriate double quotes around "official")
is the one which the paper defined, because that is the one which got
theoretically reviewed by other cryptographers.

The "56" comes from the fact that bcrypt is derived from Blowfish, which
uses keys of up to 56 bytes (and no more). However, a longer key would
fit in Blowfish as well. If we say that limiting bcrypt to 56 bytes is
an error, then so is limiting Blowfish keys to 56 bytes.


&gt; &gt; practice more often 55 or 51 characters, depending on the implementation
&gt; &gt; library),...
&gt; 
&gt; Huh?!  I've never seen implementations of bcrypt like that.  Have you?
&gt; Got any pointers?

I'll have to dig a bit around; it is old memory. The "51" apparently
comes from a faulty assumption in some usage somewhere of bcrypt that
the "55 bytes" included a 4-byte salt (which may have been true in some
variant). The "55 vs 56" is about the inclusion or not of a terminating
0.


&gt; I also don't think so, but I also don't think the portfolio should be
&gt; large.

Last I heard, some rumours talked about a dozen candidates or so, which
is not much (but it is also rumoured that rumours occasionally turn out
to be off by a long shot). This could yield a portfolio of, say, three
or four schemes.

In any case, when considering the AES and SHA-3 competitions, I usually
say that the greatest thing about them is not that they came up with a
good final choice, but that it also exposed a lot of backup schemes.
E.g. all the round-2 SHA-3 candidate schemes got a fair amount of
scrutiny, and none of them was so much as scratched in any
non-ridiculous way, so we now have 14 extra hash functions which are
"quite probably strong" and ready to be used should some issue be found
later on with the "SHA-3 winner". In the AES competition, 2 of the 15
candidates were "broken", and only in an academic way (e.g.
cryptanalysis with cost 2^100 or so), leaving us with 13 quite decent
block ciphers. Indeed, at least Serpent and TwoFish, two former AES
candidates, have pursued independent careers even though they did not
became "the" AES.

In that view, the competition will "naturally" produce a portfolio
consisting of all functions which survived. Regardless of whether one
in particular will be singled out as the winner.


&gt; not excuse us for subjecting the industry to an unnecessarily large
&gt; number of "approved" password hashing schemes.

If the industry can be persuaded to stop doing a couple of SHA-1 and
calling that "password hashing", then we would already have reason
enough to open some Champagne in celebration.
