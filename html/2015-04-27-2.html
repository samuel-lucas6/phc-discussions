&gt; So far, the best I achieved when going from AVX to AVX2 yet insisting on
&gt; 128-bit S-box lookups is:
&gt; 
&gt; AVX:
&gt; enchmarking 1 thread ...
&gt; 930 c/s real, 930 c/s virtual (1023 hashes in 1.10 seconds)
&gt; Benchmarking 8 threads ...
&gt; 3410 c/s real, 433 c/s virtual (7161 hashes in 2.10 seconds)
&gt; 
&gt; AVX2:
&gt; Benchmarking 1 thread ...
&gt; 710 c/s real, 710 c/s virtual (1023 hashes in 1.44 seconds)
&gt; Benchmarking 8 threads ...
&gt; 3580 c/s real, 458 c/s virtual (7161 hashes in 2.00 seconds)
&gt; 
&gt; at 2 MB per hash on i7-4770K, with otherwise currently default yescrypt
&gt; settings (PWXrounds=6, etc.)  As you can see, single thread performance
&gt; went down by 24%, and 8-thread went up only by 5%.
&gt; 
&gt; It's good news that attackers probably also can't use Haswell to attack
&gt; yescrypt hashes tuned for older CPUs (with 128-bit S-box lookups) much
&gt; faster.  It's bad news that defenders can't benefit from Haswell either.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like I might introduce separate pwxform settings for AVX2,
&gt; using 256-bit S-box lookups.  Maybe I'll try 512-bit as well, and see if
&gt; it becomes much weaker than bcrypt on Haswell or not (maybe target L2
&gt; cache with the S-boxes, then).  (256-bit would definitely be fine in
&gt; terms of bcrypt-like anti-GPU on Haswell.)  If it's fine then 512-bit
&gt; would be preferable in order to avoid introducing yet another
&gt; combination of settings for MIC and AVX-512.  Note: all of this fits
&gt; into yescrypt and pwxform as currently specified.  We're only talking of
&gt; adjusting the PWX* compile-time settings (and possibly making them
&gt; runtime tunable), deviating from the current defaults, and producing
&gt; optimized code for those (the -ref will run fine with only #define's
&gt; changed).

I went ahead and tried 512-bit S-box lookups right away.  While keeping
the total pwxform lanes width at 512 bits as well, I got for 8 KB
S-boxes and at 2 MB m_cost like before and on the same machine as above:

Benchmarking 1 thread ...
974 c/s real, 974 c/s virtual (1023 hashes in 1.05 seconds)
Benchmarking 8 threads ...
4068 c/s real, 530 c/s virtual (7161 hashes in 1.76 seconds)

That's with new AVX2 code.  In -ref and -opt, I only needed to change
#define's to:

#define PWXsimple 8
#define PWXgather 1
#define PWXrounds 6
#define Swidth 6

In -simd, I obviously needed to write the corresponding AVX2 code
(easy).  As we can see, there's finally a speed improvement from AVX2.
For 1 thread, it's limited by the total pwxform parallelism being too
low (only two parallel 256-bit SIMD MULs - not enough to cover their
latency).  For 8 threads, we almost bump into memory bandwidth:

2 * 4/3 * 2 * 4068 * 2^20/10^9 = 22.75 GB/s RAM+L3

Theoretical peak for i7-4770K's two memory channels is 25.6 GB/s.
There's significant L3 cache hit rate at 2 MB/thread, though.  At 128 MB,
the speed is much less:

$ ./userom 0 128
r=8 N=2^17 NROM=2^0
Will use 0.00 KiB ROM
         131072.00 KiB RAM
'$7X$F6..../....WZaPV7LSUEKMo34.$5jAouu5o7JVdj66ayBIDvinfivvXzIGkqELDufjuGK5'
Benchmarking 1 thread ...
12 c/s real, 12 c/s virtual (15 hashes in 1.18 seconds)
Benchmarking 8 threads ...
39 c/s real, 5 c/s virtual (45 hashes in 1.14 seconds)

128 * 4/3 * 2 * 39 * 2^20/10^9 = 14 GB/s RAM

(Curiously, reducing PWXrounds from 6 to 1 improves this speed only from
39 c/s to 40 c/s.  I'm not sure why this machine doesn't reach higher
memory bandwidth usage here.  Also curiously, for the 2 MB test going to
PWXrounds=1 achieves 2700 c/s for 1 thread, but makes little difference
for 8 threads.)

Now to try hitting L2 cache, still at 2 MB m_cost and PWXrounds=6 as in
most tests above:

32 KB:
Benchmarking 1 thread ...
763 c/s real, 769 c/s virtual (1023 hashes in 1.34 seconds)
Benchmarking 8 threads ...
3562 c/s real, 447 c/s virtual (7161 hashes in 2.01 seconds)

64 KB:
Benchmarking 1 thread ...
643 c/s real, 643 c/s virtual (1023 hashes in 1.59 seconds)
Benchmarking 8 threads ...
3330 c/s real, 430 c/s virtual (7161 hashes in 2.15 seconds)

128 KB:
Benchmarking 1 thread ...
568 c/s real, 568 c/s virtual (1023 hashes in 1.80 seconds)
Benchmarking 8 threads ...
2578 c/s real, 331 c/s virtual (3069 hashes in 1.19 seconds)

So up to 64 KB/thread is within consideration.  I was hoping it'd be up
to 128 KB/thread, since the CPU has 256 KB of L2/core, but no luck.
(I could introduce a change to alter Swidth every other pwxform round or
between the two S-boxes, but that would be a deviation from yescrypt as
currently specified, and extra complexity.  Alternatively, I could
increase pwxform's total parallelism beyond 512 bits per thread, which
is a mere change of the #define's in -ref and -opt, but then we'd need
to consider the effect of the extra parallelism on attacks.)

So with 64 KB/thread / 128 KB/core being rapidly hit, we still get almost
the same speed (3330 c/s vs. 3410 c/s we had with AVX and 8 KB/thread),
and our total bandwidth usage from/to RAM and the caches is:

2 * 4/3 * (2 + 2*6) * 3330 * 2^20/10^9 = 130 GB/s RAM+L3+L2

The 2*6 is two S-box lookups per pwxform round, and 6 pwxform rounds per
sub-block.  We add this to 2, which we had before and which is one read
and one write per sub-block.  (Not counted here is read bandwidth of the
previous block, which is assumed to be in L1 and read sequentially, and
write bandwidth when initializing the S-boxes.)

In terms of GPU local memory attacks, this is no worse than we had
before: the frequency of S-box lookup groups is roughly the same, so
just as bcrypt-like as before.  Or actually 8x better, since 8x fewer
instances will fit.

However, in terms of GPU global memory attacks this is different.  On
one hand, the frequency of individual S-box lookups is now 4x less (but
they're 512-bit rather than 128-bit, and they go from larger S-boxes).
On the other hand, the total bandwidth usage is so high that it's just
~2.5x less than what modern GPU cards have total.

The previous AVX with 128-bit S-box lookups code version (as submitted
to PHC) achieves comparable bandwidth usage:

2 * 4/3 * 2 * 3410 * 2^20/10^9 = 19.07 GB/s RAM+L3
2 * 4/3 * (2 + 2*6) * 3410 * 2^20/10^9 = 133 GB/s RAM+L3+L1

but its S-boxes are in L1 cache.  OTOH, it means that if trying to
attack it with a GPU with a 512-bit bus and placing the S-boxes in
global memory, it'd need 4x more bandwidth (wasting 3/4 of it), which is
more than a current GPU card has.

So I'm not sure.  Either approach looks sane to me - not using AVX2, or
using it as 512-bit.  Indeed, using it as 256-bit (which it is natively)
would be even better, but it feels too specialized to this intermediate
vector size, which is why I am experimenting with jumping over it.  But
perhaps I'll try plain 256-bit next.

For reference, the settings for 64 KB/thread are:

#define Swidth 9

#define PWXsimple 8
#define PWXgather 1

and the code is:

#define PWXFORM_SIMD_0(X, x, s0, s1) \
        x = EXTRACT64(_mm256_castsi256_si128(X)) &amp; Smask2; \
        s0 = *(const __m256i *)(S0 + (uint32_t)x); \
        s1 = *(const __m256i *)(S1 + (x &gt;&gt; 32)); \
        X = _mm256_mul_epu32(_mm256_shuffle_epi32((X), _MM_SHUFFLE(2,3,0,1)), X); \
        X = _mm256_add_epi64(X, s0); \
        X = _mm256_xor_si256(X, s1);

#define PWXFORM_SIMD_1(X, x, s0, s1) \
        s0 = *(const __m256i *)(S0 + 32 + (uint32_t)x); \
        s1 = *(const __m256i *)(S1 + 32 + (x &gt;&gt; 32)); \
        X = _mm256_mul_epu32(_mm256_shuffle_epi32((X), _MM_SHUFFLE(2,3,0,1)), X); \
        X = _mm256_add_epi64(X, s0); \
        X = _mm256_xor_si256(X, s1);

#define PWXFORM_ROUND \
        PWXFORM_SIMD_0(X0, x, s00, s01) \
        PWXFORM_SIMD_1(X1, x, s10, s11)

#define PWXFORM \
        { \
                uint64_t x; \
                __m256i s00, s01, s10, s11; \
                PWXFORM_ROUND PWXFORM_ROUND \
                PWXFORM_ROUND PWXFORM_ROUND \
                PWXFORM_ROUND PWXFORM_ROUND \
        }

(in -ref and -opt, the code remains unchanged).
