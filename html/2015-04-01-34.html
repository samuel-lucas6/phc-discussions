This is cool!!!

&gt; After over two years of in-depth analysis and careful deliberation, today the
&gt; panel is pleased to announce that LM Hash has been unanimously selected as the
&gt; winner of the PHC. To many panel members, the choice was obvious.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Selection criteria includes the following, in no particular order:
&gt; 
&gt; - LM Hash leverages the well-studied and proven DES block cipher.
&gt; 
&gt; - Most users only select passwords that are 6 – 8 characters long, so LM Hash’s
&gt; 14-character limitation is more than reasonable for the majority of use cases.
&gt; 
&gt; - LM Hash is not case-sensitive, reducing the number of password reset requests
&gt; and Help Desk tickets that result from users not remembering their precise
&gt; passwords.
&gt; 
&gt; - Most LM Hash values have already been pre-computed and made publicly
&gt; available, reducing load on authentication servers.
&gt; 
&gt; - LM Hash does not require the use of salt, which aligns with the American
&gt; Heart Association’s guidelines for a low-sodium diet.
&gt; 
&gt; - LM Hash requires little energy to compute, thereby contributing to
&gt; environment-friendly authentication systems.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As a Microsoft employee, Marsh Ray was the most vocal advocate for LM Hash,
&gt; noting that Microsoft, IBM, and 3Com have had support for LM Hash since 1988.
&gt; Alexander Peslyak added that LM Hash is the ideal PHC winner since it’s already
&gt; well-supported in John the Ripper. Jeremi Gosney and Jens Steube were quick to
&gt; agree, noting that LM Hash has all of the qualities they desire in a password
&gt; hash.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Comparing LM Hash to other PHC finalists:
&gt; 
&gt; - Unlike LM Hash, Argon and Catena are resistant to TMTO, wasting valuable CPU
&gt; cycles.
&gt; 
&gt; - Battcrypt uses Blowfish, which was developed by that charlatan Bruce
&gt; Schneier. LM Hash uses DES, which was developed by IBM and the NSA. Which do
&gt; you trust more?
&gt; 
&gt; - Lyra2 relies on a sponge for security, which is by definition full of holes.
&gt; LM Hash relies on a block cipher. Blocks don’t have holes.
&gt; 
&gt; - Pufferfish encrypts the palindrome "Drab as a fool, aloof as a bard." LM Hash
&gt; encrypts the string “kgs!@#$%”, saving the user 24 bytes.
&gt; 
&gt; - LM Hash is far simpler than yescrypt! It can be described in one line,
&gt; whereas yescrypt can't even be described in one book.
&gt; 
&gt; - Unlike Makwa, LM Hash is post-quantum!
&gt; 
&gt; - Parallel was designed by Steve Thomas, who you can't trust to hash your
&gt; password. LM Hash wasn't designed by Steve but by trusted Microsoft experts.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Being the choice of foremost thought leaders in the field, LM Hash is already a
&gt; success:
&gt; 
&gt; - LM Hash will appear in the next Gartner Magic Quadrant for state-of-the-art
&gt; password hashing.
&gt; 
&gt; - Academic researchers have started applying for grants in order to investigate
&gt; security proofs of LM Hash in the related-password model under relaxed
&gt; misuse-resistance assumptions. Leading researchers already expect breakthrough
&gt; indifferentiability proofs in the ideal cipher model.
&gt; 
&gt; - A new secure messaging application will generate one-time-pad masks from user
&gt; passwords using LM Hash, promising higher security than legacy solutions such
&gt; as TextSecure.
