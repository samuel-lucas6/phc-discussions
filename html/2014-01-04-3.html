&gt; Summary: NOELKDF may be a lot faster than escrypt on SIMD-less builds,
&gt; but might be almost same speed when benchmarked against SIMD-enabled
&gt; builds.  The question is then how SIMD'able NOELKDF is, and how fast
&gt; those builds will run.

Looking at:

    for(i = 1; i &lt; PAGE_LENGTH - 1; i++) {
        *toPage++ = *prevPage + ((*fromPage * *(prevPage + 1)) ^ *(fromPage - 1));
        prevPage++;
        fromPage++;
    }

I'd say it's almost SIMD'able, with expected up to 2x speedup on this
machine (64-bit changes to 128-bit), although in practice probably much
less (because this CPU has more integer ALUs than SIMD units).  Hmm, I
don't recall if we have 64-bit integer multiplication in SIMD form yet;
we certainly do have 32-bit starting with SSE4.1.  The SIMD intrinsics
for 32-bit are _mm_mullo_epi32() (SSE4.1), _mm256_mullo_epi32 (AVX2),
and there's also _mm_macc_epi32 (XOP).  Googling for these with 32
replaced by 64 gives almost no results, suggesting that we have no
64-bit forms.  So perhaps it'd take a downgrade to 32-bit mults here in
order to make it SIMD'able, which is unfortunate.  Then actually making
use of SIMD will become more important (32 to 128), and worse security
will be achieved on pre-SSE4.1 CPUs (as well as on any other archs/CPUs
not offering 32-bit SIMD mults).

This assumes that the three "pages" don't overlap (BTW, adding the
"restrict" keyword might provide some speedup, then, but it's risky
since it's a contract not to be violated).  This brings us to what I
think is a vulnerability in NOELKDF: too much parallelism inside the
loop above, where all loop iterations look independent from each other.
Excessive parallelism (more than the defender is likely to use) is bad
for memory-hard KDFs.  It lets the attacker reduce the time factor in
area*time without increasing the area as much (only increasing it by the
size of extra cores).

A tunable amount of parallelism would need to be introduced here, to be
set roughly to the defender's (current or near future) expected SIMD
vector width times number of SIMD units/thread plus instruction latency.
The latency can be many cycles for the MULs (even though in terms of
throughput it's generally at least one per cycle on modern CPUs).

Luckily, the simplicity of NOELKDF makes these changes easier than for
escrypt.

Note: I don't comment on the rest of NOELKDF's security yet - I have not
given it enough review and thought.  It is unclear whether it can stay
almost this simple yet be secure; we're just not aware of attacks yet.
