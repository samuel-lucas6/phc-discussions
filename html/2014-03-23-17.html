Indeed, I have a strong tendency for verbosity.


&gt; Being on the panel for PHC, I am aware that you made this submission
&gt; (thank you!), but I did not look at it closely yet because (1) I didn't
&gt; have time for that yet, and (2) you didn't make it public yet, which
&gt; might be deliberate, so I didn't want to be "exposed" to it yet (given
&gt; my plans to possibly make a PHC submission too).

That's more a consequence of my own mental rigidity, and a habit from
previous competitions: radio silence until the deadline.

My candidate (called "Makwa"), in a nutshell, is based on squarings
modulo a composite integer N (a Blum integer, i.e. the product of two
bir primes p and q such that p and q are equal to 3 modulo 4). Input
password is first padded into a big integer modulo N (deterministic
padding, using a custom KDF and the salt), then squared repeatedly. Pre-
and post-hashing (again with the KDF) can be optionally applied, if you
want to support an arbitrarily long input password and/or an unbiased
and short output.

When p and q are not known, there seems to be no known shortcut to
doing all the squarings. When p and q are known, however, computations
can be done modulo p and modulo q, and assembled with the CRT, so the
total cost is about the same as a RSA private key operation, regardless
of the actual work factor (number of squarings): that's the "fast path".

Offline cost upgrade is done by simply taking the value and squaring it
again (note: post-hashing breaks that functionality). Squaring is a
permutation of quadratic residues modulo a Blum integer, so there is no
"space reduction" to fear here. If p and q are known, offline cost
_downgrades_ are possible as well (ultimately, it can also serve as an
escrow mechanism for the password).

Delegation indeed uses some kind of blinding, though not the same as RSA
blinding. Normal RSA blinding is about choosing a random r, multiplying
with r^e on entry and 1/r on exit. Here, the exponent "e" is equal to a
big power of 2, and computing that blinding would be as expensive as
computing the whole function, which defeats the purpose. Instead, I
precompute 300 "blinding pairs" and I apply a random selection of them.
This is akin to a multiplicative knapsack problem. The cost of
delegation is then close to that of a RSA private key operation.


As can be seen, such a function is not memory hard; the bulk of
computations fit in about 256 bytes (for a 2048-bit modulus). By all
rights, a GPU or, even more so, a dedicated ASIC ought to be quite
faster than a plain PC for such jobs. The idea of Makwa is that
delegation allows for harnessing external systems (including the
connecting clients themselves), making up for that relative
inefficiency. It seems, though, that the boost that can be achieved with
a GPU for a given budget is not that big, because modular squarings is
all multiplications, and modern x86 are very good at it (in particular,
they have a fast 64x64-&gt;128 multiplier).


&gt; The code in OpenBSD is the spec.

I guess that's the point. I come from the "academic crypto world" where
articles rule, and implementations are only secondary elements of often
poor quality. In these circles, the notion of "the code is the spec" is
quite alien.
