&gt; 1) Constant cost for each round
&gt; 2) Fully deterministic from the current round number (baked into the PHF)
&gt; like Catena
&gt; 3) Defined externally but globally for all passwords (e.g. a static array of
&gt; cost parameters for each round)
&gt; 4) Defined explicitly in the hash serialization (possibly unique per
&gt; password)
&gt;
&gt; Each trade-off some flexibility in controlling the cost for simplicity. IMO
&gt; #2 or #3 are good options.

I came to the same conclusion when trying to come up with a decent way
to integrate memory-hard password hashing into TrueCrypt.  It's
tricky, but your options #2 and #3 are the two I still consider good
solutions.

&gt; As Bill/Solar point out, the other trade-off to increasing cost by slapping
&gt; on additional rounds is latency increasing faster than cost, up to 3x as
&gt; much. Adding a second round with the same cost parameters increases cost and
&gt; latency equally. But adding a second round with "better" cost settings means
&gt; the first round is "wasting" latency using the wrong cost settings. Alex
&gt; says it better;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Another/worse drawback is that area-time cost for upgraded hashes is lower
&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt; it can be for same-duration new hashes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So this raises the question of whether we should actually have two different
&gt; integers allowing us to change cost both ways. Just one example way to do
&gt; this... assuming approach #2 or #3 above, serialize two integers;
&gt;
&gt; - A 'r1' parameter indicates the 'starting round'
&gt; - A 'r2' parameter indicates the 'ending round'
&gt;
&gt; When you are upgrading all your hashes in your database offline, you
&gt; increase 'r2'. When the user successfully logs in, you can then change 'r1'
&gt; and 'r2' arbitrarily, possibly making 'r1' = 'r2'. This means you'll only
&gt; need to use the less efficient method until the next time the user
&gt; successfully logs in after you've done an offline upgrade.

I think Catena already does exactly this scheme.  I implemented
"garlic" exactly this way when adding Catena's garlic function to my
PHS.

&gt; I think the trade-offs are more complexity, and a signal of how recently the
&gt; user has logged in -- both embedded in the hash serialization, as well as
&gt; through timing the login latency. You could hide both the serialized
&gt; indicator as well as the timing attack at the cost of even more complexity
&gt; and some loss of flexibility. To exploit the timing attack would require a
&gt; number of invalid login attempts to a valid username, which you want to
&gt; defend against in any case.

I hadn't even realized this leaks how long it has been since a user
logged in.  Simply keeping any sort of memory or time cost parameter
alongside salt has this same problem.

&gt; Sometimes the last time the user logged in is public information anyway. But
&gt; if you need to protect this, I think you can at least decrease the latency
&gt; delta through careful choice of cost parameters. If you start at 5/5
&gt; (meaning a single round at cost '5') and increase all hashes offline to be
&gt; 5/7 (consecutive rounds at 5, 6, 7) then you want to find the single round
&gt; (8/8?) which matches the latency of 5/7 as closely as possible. But this may
&gt; be difficult or impossible in practice due to 8/8 having completely
&gt; different resource contention than 5/7... but that's the whole point.
&gt;
&gt; Solar discussed a lot of this under the 'cost upgrade' thread. But if we all
&gt; stopped writing just because Solar said it earlier, the list would be a
&gt; whole lot quieter! :-)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jeremy

And reading everything guys like Solar have posted would spoil the fun
of reinventing it!
