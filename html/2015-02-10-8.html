Hi Arpan,

Thank you for your clarifications.

&gt; 1) Well, this is just a matter of interpretation of the sentence "Intel
&gt; Core i7-4770CPU with 16GB RAM at 2400 MHz" from page 14 of RIG-v2.pdf.
&gt; English can sometimes be ambiguous, and a sentence can have multiple
&gt; possible interpretations. We have mentioned the setup in a more detailed
&gt; way in code: <a href="https://github.com/arpanj/Rig/blob/master/Rig_v2-opt/main.c" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/arpanj/Rig/blob/master/Rig_v2-opt/main.c</a>
&gt; 
&gt; GCC v4.9.1 (CFLAGS=-std=c99 -mavx2 -O3 -funroll-loops)
&gt; CPU: Intel Core i7 4770 (Turbo Boost: ON)
&gt; RAM: Double Channel DDR3 16 GB (2400 MHz)
&gt; 
&gt; So, the CPU was working at normal Turbo-Boost frequency of 3.9 GHz, without
&gt; throttling during the experiments. The memory speed was specified as it was
&gt; higher than normal of 1366/1600 MHz, albeit having higher latency.

Oh, this is clear now.  (I could have guessed, but somehow did not.)
One more detail you could want to include: did you build for x86-64 or
for 32-bit x86?

In the scrypt benchmarks I posted yesterday, it was normal DDR3-1600
memory (4 sticks, 32 GB total, but this CPU has only two memory channels
anyway, so I'd expect the same speeds with 2 sticks).

I built yescrypt-0.7.1 (as currently in PHC) and @floodyberry's
scrypt-jane with these packages' default gcc flags and "gcc version
4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)" for x86-64.

&gt; 2) Regarding the benchmarks we did use the reference code initially,
&gt; because in the first version of our submission, we were not using SSE/AVX.
&gt; Secondly, for smaller block sizes, the SSE/AVX implementations tend to
&gt; yield much lesser performance benefits, because of memory
&gt; latency/allocation overheads.
&gt; 
&gt; It would have been better to include optimized / SSE benchmarks for scrypt
&gt; too.
&gt; 
&gt; The best thing would be to have two graphs with multiple candidates from
&gt; PHC with both the optimized and reference versions as some CPU's especially
&gt; mobile ones may not have SSE/AVX and would need to fallback on the
&gt; reference implementations.

I think there's almost no point in benchmarking the reference
implementations when there's also an optimized non-SIMD implementation,
like it's the case in the original scrypt tarball.  The -ref file is
just for studying it and for testing of other implementations against
it.  It's not for actual use at all, not even as a fallback.  There's
-nosse (or -opt in yescrypt) and -sse (or -simd in yescrypt) for actual
use.  So if you proceed with benchmarks, you should be comparing your
non-SIMD code against scrypt's -nosse (or/and yescrypt's -opt), and your
SIMD code against scrypt's -sse (or/and yescrypt's -simd or
scrypt-jane).  I'd be interested in seeing such benchmark results.

The -opt version in yescrypt is not yet as fully optimized as yescrypt's
-simd, though.  The blk{cpy,xor} may be fully avoided even in -opt, but
so far I only did that in -simd, because at this time that's what I care
about more and because this optimization makes more of a difference on
overall performance there.  We could want to optimize (ye)scrypt's -opt
more fully if we want to use it as a baseline for benchmarks.

That said, here are yescrypt's -opt and -ref benchmarks (computing
classic scrypt) on the same machine I used for yesterday's SIMD
benchmarks:

-opt:

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 1) = 21 01 cb 9b 6a 51 1a ae ad db be 09 cf 70 f8 81 ec 56 8d 57 4a 2f fd 4d ab e5 ee 98 20 ad aa 47 8e 56 fd 8f 4b a5 d0 9f fa 1c 6d 92 7c 40 f4 c3 37 30 40 49 e8 a9 52 fb cb f4 5c 6f a7 7a 41 a4

real    0m2.470s
user    0m2.212s
sys     0m0.224s

-ref:

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 1) = 21 01 cb 9b 6a 51 1a ae ad db be 09 cf 70 f8 81 ec 56 8d 57 4a 2f fd 4d ab e5 ee 98 20 ad aa 47 8e 56 fd 8f 4b a5 d0 9f fa 1c 6d 92 7c 40 f4 c3 37 30 40 49 e8 a9 52 fb cb f4 5c 6f a7 7a 41 a4

real    0m2.745s
user    0m2.508s
sys     0m0.204s

And here's the original scrypt code benchmarked on the same machine,
same gcc, "CFLAGS = -Wall -march=native -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer", -sse:

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 1) = 21 01 cb 9b 6a 51 1a ae ad db be 09 cf 70 f8 81 ec 56 8d 57 4a 2f fd 4d ab e5 ee 98 20 ad aa 47 8e 56 fd 8f 4b a5 d0 9f fa 1c 6d 92 7c 40 f4 c3 37 30 40 49 e8 a9 52 fb cb f4 5c 6f a7 7a 41 a4

real    0m1.801s
user    0m1.548s
sys     0m0.224s

-nosse:

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 1) = 21 01 cb 9b 6a 51 1a ae ad db be 09 cf 70 f8 81 ec 56 8d 57 4a 2f fd 4d ab e5 ee 98 20 ad aa 47 8e 56 fd 8f 4b a5 d0 9f fa 1c 6d 92 7c 40 f4 c3 37 30 40 49 e8 a9 52 fb cb f4 5c 6f a7 7a 41 a4

real    0m2.728s
user    0m2.468s
sys     0m0.240s

-ref:

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 1) = 21 01 cb 9b 6a 51 1a ae ad db be 09 cf 70 f8 81 ec 56 8d 57 4a 2f fd 4d ab e5 ee 98 20 ad aa 47 8e 56 fd 8f 4b a5 d0 9f fa 1c 6d 92 7c 40 f4 c3 37 30 40 49 e8 a9 52 fb cb f4 5c 6f a7 7a 41 a4

7 seconds is pretty bad indeed, but not as bad as the almost 12 seconds
you observed.  Maybe the gcc flags were very different, or something.

I think the original scrypt tarball's -ref is this slow primarily
because it includes le32dec() and le32enc() right inside salsa20_8(),
for clarity (to avoid mixing up the different layers), and these are
going to functions in another source file rather than inlined.

Thanks again,

Alexander
