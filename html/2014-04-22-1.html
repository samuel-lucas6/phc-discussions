 initial review)

Hi Bill,

Please feel free to benchmark the optimized Argon with 4/8/16 threads.

Regarding the memory bandwidth, Argon with default parameters accesses each
memory location 12 times for reading and 11 times for writing on average
(Section 6.4 of the submission document). If I understand your metrics
correctly, this gives 23x multiplier on the speed that is around 9 cycles
per byte for 1 GB of RAM used (330 MB/sec on a 3 GHz CPU).

Best regards,
Dmitry

&gt; Yesterday, I had some fun benchmarking Lyra2, TwoCats, and Yescrypt.  Are
&gt; there any other authors who would like their algorithms benchmarked?  I'd
&gt; be happy to start tabulating data on all the entries that are ready for
&gt; benchmarking.  After yesterday's hack-fest, I don't feel simply running the
&gt; PHS routines without the involvement of the author is likely to generate
&gt; useful data, so I'm only going to do benchmarking the authors request for
&gt; now.
&gt;
&gt; We should discuss what to measure and how to report it.  Is there a better
&gt; place than posting it here?
&gt;
&gt; I think we maybe we need three memory size categories, where PHC entries
&gt; can be benchmarked in any or all of them.  Basically, the 3 memory sizes
&gt; correspond to:
&gt;
&gt; - L1 cache bound:  how about 8KiB?
&gt; - Cache bound: how about 8MiB?
&gt; - External DRAM bound: how about 2GiB?
&gt;
&gt; Also, some are not memory bound, for PBKDF2-like entries.  It's best if we
&gt; stick to powers of two for memory size, as some entries require that.
&gt;
&gt; The simplest thing to report is how long a algorithm takes to run to hash
&gt; for a given amount of memory, so I think we should report that.  However,
&gt; it needs to be interpreted based on what the algorithm is doing.  Assuming
&gt; the algorithm is linear in runtime for the range of memory in the category
&gt; (for example, heavily external DRAM bound), then we can can convert runtime
&gt; to now many MiB or GiB would be hashed in a 1 second runtime, by dividing
&gt; the memory hashed by the runtime.  This let's us compare the memory*time
&gt; cost for a 1 second runtime, and obviously higher is better.
&gt;
&gt; An important modification to the GiB/s hashed is the expected "average"
&gt; memory usage for a 1 second run.  Several entries call malloc or a similar
&gt; function to allocate uninitialized memory, and in a first loop they fill
&gt; that memory.  Linux does not allocate physical memory to malloc-ed address
&gt; space until it is accessed, so memory usage increases roughly linearly for
&gt; the first memory filling loop.  TwoCats fills memory and is done, so it's
&gt; average memory usage is only 1/2 of the total.  Others mostly write to
&gt; memory more than once, and so they reach peak memory early in the
&gt; algorithm.  For example Scrypt would be expected to have around a 75%
&gt; average memory usage relative to the total used, since it fills memory
&gt; linearly in the first loop and hashes it once in the second loop.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, there's memory bandwidth, which should be in terms of MiB or GiB
&gt; per second read/write to DRAM or cache.  Memory bandwidth is the primary
&gt; runtime defense for a lot of the entries, so having high bandwidth is very
&gt; important.  We can estimate memory bandwidth by the total memory hashed
&gt; divided by runtime, times the number of memory accesses on average.  Cache
&gt; adds a complication when estimating external DRAM bandwidth, but so far
&gt; we've been able to guestimate which reads are most likely cached, and
&gt; discount them for external DRAM bandwidth.  For example, for TwoCats, I
&gt; estimate each DRAM location is written on average once, and read on average
&gt; once, the same as Scrypt.
&gt;
&gt; Are these the right metrics?
&gt;
&gt; Bill
