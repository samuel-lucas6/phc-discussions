Subject: Best RNG for filling memory?

For the random number generator to fill memory, I found "modified" ARC4, by
Jianliang Zheng and Jie Li:

<a href="http://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/fps2012/program/slides/59.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/fps2012/program/slides/59.pdf</a>

I just benchmarked it, and it's faster on my core i7 than the SSE version
of blake2s, and slightly slower than blake2b.  Not that my opinion counts,
but I'm a fan of blake2 as a stream cipher since it's very fast and ARC4
has known long-term correlations in it's output.  I'm not sure there is any
future for MARC as a stream cipher.  However, for memory-hard key
stretching, MARC is very simple, and extremely fast.  It is slightly faster
than blake2b-ref (64-bit reference version without SSE extensions), and
slightly slower than blake2b (with SSE).  It's faster than both versions of
blake2s (32 bit version).  No other cryto-strength RNG I know of is
anywhere near as fast as MARC and blake2.  Since we only generate a 256 bit
hash in the end, I don't think long-term correlations of 1-bit per 10MB is
an issue, so I'm leaning towards MARC for it's simplicity and CPU
architecture independence.

I was wrong that DDR memory bandwidth would be the limiting factor.  Modern
dual-channel DDR has something like 10GB/s per channel, for 20GB/s total.
 On my quad-core 3GHz Intel Core i7, MARC generated 1GB/s.  With 4
processes at the same time, it generated 0.9GB/s per process.  Clearly
memory bandwidth is not the main bottleneck for filling memory.  I'll need
to test even more efficient reading/hashing to see if 4 threads can make
use of the full memory bandwidth.  I think maximizing data transfer from
memory is the best way to make ASIC implementations more costly.  I'm
tempted to make use of integer multiplication and maybe even the FPU to
make the ASIC version more expensive, but why?  An ASIC will be pad-limited
just by the DRAM interface, so I won't make the ASIC any more expensive by
trying to use the CPU's integer pipelines.  If you do IBM's distributed pad
flip-chip thing, you add something like $100 per chip, totally blowing out
the ASIC cost.  Wire bond is the only cheap solution, and these ASICs will
clearly be pad limited.  Making use of the FPU adds risk that an FPU bug
would cause the hash to be wrong, and the integer pipeline, even with
barrel shifter and multiplier, are tiny dots on a die.

I somewhat disagree with a statement from the FAQ.  With N cores, we can
compute the hash in 1/N-th the time only if memory bandwidth is not the
bottleneck.  Our challenge is to fill up that memory bandwidth with page
transfers, and that is the only reason to use multiple threads.  If 4
threads on an 8-core processor fill up memory bandwidth, there is no reason
to get the other 4 cores involved.  An ASIC version will shrink those cores
to tiny state machines in any case, and using all 8 cores does very little
to increase the cost of an the ASIC, which naturally will be memory
bandwidth limited.  I think we should use the simplest hashing algorithm
possible on the random page reads to minimize the number of threads
required to fill the memory pipe.  There's no reason to bring a machine to
it's knees while we do the hashing if it provides no security benefit.
 Leaving a core or two available for other tasks would be good, IMO.

Thoughts?  I'm on my own here, and not being a crypto guy by trade, any
random thoughts are appreciated.
