&gt; In particular, is it a good idea to enable this on any (other) deviation
&gt; from classic scrypt, without requiring that this feature itself be
&gt; requested explicitly?

I don't think it's important to be able to use this feature while
everything else remains Script compatible.  The password collision
problem hasn't seemed to be a problem in the wild so far, and if a
user is going to upgrade his password hashing scheme, I'd hope he'd
consider using some of your other features, and not just this one.

I guess I would prefer to specify if I want script compatibility, and
if I say I don't need it, then then this should be enabled, along with
any other improvement.

I think your solution to the collision problem is cool.  You fixed the
biggest drawback of how HMAC is used in PBKDF2, as if you'd simply
gone in and deleted the offending if statement and forced SHA256 to
always be called on the password.  You added a line to effectively
delete one.

&gt; This pre-hashing serves two purposes:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Avoid the trivial "collisions" discussed in here, where a &gt;64 chars
&gt; password and its SHA-256 hash would have produced the same yescrypt
&gt; hash.  This is no longer the case, except in scrypt compatibility mode.

I like this solution better than XORing the length into the hash
afterwards.  It eliminates my banana attack for trying to guess the
password length.  The value of eliminating a banana attack like that
is just to quell any noise that might result, but that's enough reason
to use this new scheme, IMO.  I think I'd prefer that there be some
"compatibility" boolean option, and if true, then use the old scheme,
otherwise, use the new scheme as well as any other upgrades you've
added.

I did something more dangerous in the version of TwoCats I finally
submitted.  A while ago I upgraded from PBKDF2 to HKDF, but in the
submitted version, I just hash all the inputs, including lengths, to
form the PRK.  I know I don't understand the design of HKDF well
enough to guarantee my PHS has no need to call HKDF.  This may cause
TwoCats to fall early in cryptanalysis, but since I'm already rolling
my own memory hash function, I figure I might as take other risks.
Besides, it's more fun to roll your own :-p

I also eliminated user-selectable output hash lengths,  I have no idea
how important this feature is to users, but I just didn't feel right
providing a longer hash with no additional security.  I've seen a few
guys on the TrueCrypt forum argue that their 512 bit salt provides
more password security than anyone will ever need, and therefore,
memory-hard password hashing schemes are not needed.  I imagine they
would be thrilled to have the added security of a 2048 bit password
hash.

&gt; 2. Ability to upgrade raw SHA-256 hashes, which unfortunately are in use
&gt; by some sites, to yescrypt hashes.  The specific choice of SHA-256 is
&gt; simply because it's used in (ye)scrypt anyway, but it happens to be
&gt; somewhat relevant for such upgrades.  Indeed, this sort of upgrades are
&gt; always possible, but now for raw SHA-256's the resulting hashes would be
&gt; genuine yescrypt hashes, with no need to record that they've been
&gt; upgraded from raw SHA-256.  (For upgrading anything else to yescrypt,
&gt; such info would still need to be recorded.)

By raw SHA-256 hashes, do you mean just a hash of the password,
without even salt?  I'm sure this is how many people store passwords.
It's probably the second most common technique after just storing the
password as plain text.  In fact, I wrote a web site a few years ago
that stored passwords... I'm going have to go see how security
ignorant I was and read the old code...

I just read it.  Sure enough, all I did was store SHA256(password ||
salt).  Except for the lack of key stretching, is this insecure?  I'm
sure JtR would have torn up my password database in a hurry.

&gt; Another relevant change is that first block of output from the first
&gt; PBKDF2 call is now preserved (during most computation) in place of the
&gt; original password, and is rolled into the final PBKDF2.  This change
&gt; serves two purposes:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Not only password entropy, but also salt entropy, is (by)passed into
&gt; the final PBKDF2, so that even if the memory-hard portion of yescrypt
&gt; catastrophically fails to preserve entropy, both the password and the
&gt; salt affect the final hash anyway.  This way, it can be said that
&gt; yescrypt's cryptographic security depends solely on that of SHA-256,
&gt; HMAC, and PBKDF2, but not on any of its heavy/custom/complicated parts.
&gt; For scrypt, the same can be said for the password, but not for the salt.
&gt; A catastrophic failure of SMix (and below) would potentially result in
&gt; scrypt having easy collisions for same password with different salts.
&gt; This is no longer so for yescrypt.

I also preserve the original PRK computed at the start of a level of
garlic, and hash it with the result of memory hashing.  I think this
is the right solution.  It does bother me that I'm keeping data in
memory that is isolated from the password by only a single
cryptographic hash, but I prefer this to the possibility that the
resulting hash could be weaker than what I started with.  Even if
memory hashing did lose a ton of entropy, it may be OK with this
solution.  For example, if you have 256 bits of entropy coming out of
SHA256, and only have 64 bits left at the end, I think it's no problem
with this scheme.

&gt; 2. It is possible to zeroize the password early on, keeping only the
&gt; PBKDF2(SHA-256(password), salt) during most computation.  (I did not
&gt; include this in the code yet, but now it's a matter of implementation.)
&gt; Of course, PBKDF2 at 1 iteration is quick, yet it's better than
&gt; plaintext, and better than a saltless hash.

I remain a fan of zeroing the password, even though it's a flawed
system that may not work very well, as you pointed out before.  If
it's hard for us to get right, how can we expect users to do it?

I have this system which might add more complexity than it's worth,
where I apply levels of garlic from 0 .. memCost-6 before applying the
main level of memCost.  Each level isolates the current hash from
password by another memory hashing round twice as large.  That does
two things: it gives the remaining hash in memory a bit more strength
in case it is leaked, and it hopefully it causes earlier versions of
the PRK to be overwritten on the stack or wherever the optimizer
decided to stuff it.

&gt; If desired, a tunable parameter may now be added to make it multiple
&gt; iterations of PBKDF2 for this first block.  In terms of code, a
&gt; separate instance of PBKDF2 would need to be invoked for 256-bit
&gt; derived key size, and it would just happen to produce the same results
&gt; as the current code when the iteration count is set to 1.  Before this
&gt; change, hacking in more PBKDF2 iterations relative to classic scrypt
&gt; would unnecessarily waste CPU time on additional PBKDF2 output blocks.

With an upgrade to scrypt, I would appreciate this feature.  For a
1-ish second memory hash, I cant see why I would want to spend less
than 10ms on pure SHA256 hashing of the password before allocating
multiple GiB of memory.  It also allows you to claim you're at least
as strong as something like 2000 rounds of PBKDF2-SHA256.  It's a
simpler solution than my application of a few low levels of garlic.

&gt; The post-hashing allows for most computation to be done on the client
&gt; while producing the same yescrypt hashes that are produced with 100%
&gt; server-side computation.  This is similar to Catena's "Server Relief".
&gt; I implemented it in a way that fits SCRAM (RFC 5802) to the extent
&gt; possible, so that existing yescrypt hashes stored on a server (sometime
&gt; in the future) would happen to be usable with a straightforward
&gt; extension of RFC 5802 (to appear at an even later future time).

Does that mean you implemented these steps from the RFC?

SaltedPassword  := Hi(Normalize(password), salt, i)
ClientKey       := HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
StoredKey       := H(ClientKey)

I guess Hi would be replaced with a call to yescript?  I'm not sure
why they're concerned about the encoding of the password.  It seems
odd to me to force it to be in UTF8.  Is there a reason to treat it
differently than a buffer of uint8_t data?

One thing that bugs me is that server-relief mode involves sending the
salt to anyone who is allowed to try to authenticate.  It seems like
there should be a better way.

&gt; BTW, there's some nice confusion in RFC 5802 regarding the order of
&gt; arguments to HMAC().  Tweets:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;solardiz&gt; In RFCs, is it HMAC(msg, key) (per RFC 2104's code) or HMAC(key, msg)? RFC 5802 <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802#page-8" rel="nofollow">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802#page-8</a> vs. Dovecot <a href="http://hg.dovecot.org/dovecot-2.2/file/d55ae5d268a2/src/auth/mech-scram-sha1.c#l223" rel="nofollow">http://hg.dovecot.org/dovecot-2.2/file/d55ae5d268a2/src/auth/mech-scram-sha1.c#l223</a>
&gt; &lt;solardiz&gt; I guess RFC 5802 assumes HMAC(key, msg). Is the ordering of HMAC() args specified in an RFC? <a href="http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-scram.c#n346" rel="nofollow">http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-scram.c#n346</a> <a href="http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-utils.c#n43" rel="nofollow">http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/sjoerd/wocky.git/tree/wocky/wocky-sasl-utils.c#n43</a>
&gt; &lt;+&#64;...f&gt; @solardiz Well, the source code in Krawcyk's RFC does M(msg, key) :)
&gt; &lt;@solardiz&gt; @tqbf Right. So RFC 5802's use of HMAC() looks inconsistent with RFC 2104. Either that, or multiple implementations got it wrong.
&gt; &lt;@solardiz&gt; @tqbf It's easy to verify RFC 5802's intent, though: it includes test vectors. I just don't have time right now. Anyone?
&gt; &lt;solardiz&gt; Impls of RFC 5802 with its test vectors, thus presumably tested: <a href="http://bm2.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1222/trunk/src/login/SASL_ScramSha1.java" rel="nofollow">http://bm2.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1222/trunk/src/login/SASL_ScramSha1.java</a> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sco0ter/babbler/src/6e5daf195414/src/test/java/org/xmpp/sasl/?at=default" rel="nofollow">https://bitbucket.org/sco0ter/babbler/src/6e5daf195414/src/test/java/org/xmpp/sasl/?at=default</a> Confirms HMAC(key, msg)
&gt;
&gt; Alexander

Does this mean that they are passing the password as the message, and
the salt as the key, the way HKDF does?  That seems to be the prefered
solution, though I like yours better: passing H(password) as the key,
and the salt as the salt.  HKDF has salt input collisions instead of
password collisions.
