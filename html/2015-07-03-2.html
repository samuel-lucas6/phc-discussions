Concerning claims for Turing Completeness, here is an argument to the contrary, below.

I don't understand this hand-waving about Turing completeness.  Or, as has been said in other contexts, "I don't think this means what it is being used to mean."

In particular, it is not enough to be a Turing Machine in order to be a Universal Turing Machine.  Collapsing the terms together creates mischief''
 
Ugh... this is trivially Turing complete.  Can I ask you do to a bit of the proof yourself?
 
ARX instructions are Turing complete.  Google it.  He's got all kinds of constants in the data space to use in operations.  I let the salt determine branching, which leads to O(n^2) memory to write any regular program of length n.  Can you figure it out or do I have to spell it out?  I hate showing my work :-)

&lt;orcmid&gt;
The fact that the ARX processor is Turing complete (to within finiteness) does not mean that the little interpreter that implements the self-overwriting “Turing Machine” is Turing Complete.  Turing Completeness is not transitive to programs running on a Turing Complete Machine (although a few might simulate the original Turing Complete machine or some other Turing Complete machine, most will not).
 
One test is to prove that you can simulate a Universal Turing machine (or equivalent) with it.  For example, can you construct inputs that cause the self-overwriting guy to simulate the ARX processor itself?   
 
Or, forgetting ARX itself, can you prove that there are configurations of the BusyBeaverKDF parameters that basically provide for all computable functions from n-bit unsigned integers to n-bit unsigned integers.  That is, capture all of the subset of computable functions that are n-bit to n-bit.
 
I think not.  Look at it this way.  
 
BusyBeaverKDF can be viewed as a function BBK(nrOps): S x Z -&gt; Z  where S and Z are both 64-byte unsigned integers.  So S and Z are independent 2^512 value domains.  
 
You can look at BBK(nrOps)(salt) one being essentially one of 2^512 functions, Z -&gt; Z for each fixed parameter nrOps (probably 32 bits, not more than 64 bits typically.  
 
Now, the supposed total number of functions, Z -&gt; Z for Z having 2^512 members is 2^(2^512).  That’s a *lot* more than the number of functions than the 2^512 values in S can select among (and that assumes no duplicates arise in the selection).  
 
In addition, *all* of the 2^(2^512) are computable.  Z is a finite domain, so they are enumerable.  
 
While nrOps complicates things, it is too small (not more than 8 bytes) to overcome this limitation and very large values of nrOps impact running time too much.  Also, too small values of nrOps don’t produce much transformation in the iterative BusyBeaver operations.
 
So, whatever properties BusyBeaverKDF has, and many of them are doubtless very interesting to understand from a security perspective, being Turing Complete is not one of them.  Turing Completeness might even be a bad idea in this context.
 
We can look deeper into the construction of BusyBeaverKDF to show that it does not escape the above limitations.  They are inescapable just from the restrictions on the parameters though.  
&lt;/orcmid&gt;
