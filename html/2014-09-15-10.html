&gt;&gt; It remains to be seen if there is an effective TMTO attack 
&gt;&gt; against Catena.  Using even 1 fewer memory locations increases 
&gt;&gt; recomputations considerably.  However, the defense increases 
&gt;&gt; somewhat slowly, and by a 1/8 memory attack (compared to the 1/4 
&gt;&gt; that Catena starts with), Catena starts losing against other 
&gt;&gt; algorithms in my pebbling attacks.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This paragraph: - ignores the attacks mounted by the Catena 
&gt; designers; - ignores the lower bound proof given in the submission;
&gt; - ignores the fact that the proof has a mistake (acknowledged by
&gt; the designers); - ignores the tradeoff attacks found by our team
&gt; (also acknowledged by the designers and verified by other people in
&gt; the mailing list).
&gt; 
&gt; It also does not tell us what are the penalties (found by the 
&gt; author or someone else) for running Catena with 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 of 
&gt; the memory or whatever.

Sorry, but I simply do not buy your team's TMTO attack against Catena.
 Your assumption that power drops as TMTO increases is wrong.
However, I am impressed with your 15-ish percent improvement on my
auto-pebbler's attack. :-)  That is quite impressive.

Did I forget to mention the 9X-ish penalty I was seeing at the 1/2
memory mark?  I call that a 1/8th TMTO, since the computation DAG has
8X more nodes than we have memory locations at that point.  Since it
gets worse faster as we go for deeper TMTOs, I think showing that a 2X
memory reduction is good enough.

Even if we get the recomputations down to 8X for 1/2 memory, the power
increase will hurt an attacker more than it's worth, IMO.  Going for
parallel recomputations will also make this worse.  I still doubt that
in reality we will ever see a beneficial TMTO against Catena.  When
they do occur, more likely it will be a desperate hack to get memory
to fit on an attacker's chip.

So... I'll start quoting your analysis when you figure out that power
goes up instead of down with a TMTO.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ASIC Defense - ------------
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; The ASIC discussion also: - does not introduce any reference 
&gt; attacker's platform, where the cost is computed; - ignores the 
&gt; existing SHA-512 and Blake-512 ASIC implementation, their 
&gt; latencies, voltages, frequencies etc. compared to that of DRAM or 
&gt; SRAM designs available on the market or in the development.

As in all my reviews, I assume the attacker and defender use the same
silicon process.  My benchmark machine is 22nm used for Ivy Bridge,
and I assume the ASIC is in the same process.  I assume the same clock
speed as my CPU: 3.4GHz, and try to make a WAG about relative power
use based on how much cache vs logic is in use, but it's just a WAG.

These assumptions simplify analysis a ton!  However, I do not claim
that this is the best way to go about a real ASIC attack.  It is too
expensive, for one thing.

&gt;&gt; Contrary to what has been posted in the discussion forum, a TMTO 
&gt;&gt; against Catena will almost certainly *increase* power, rather 
&gt;&gt; than decrease.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; Whereas the other statements can be considered as a matter of 
&gt; taste, this one can be verified rather easily. Let us take the 
&gt; platform on where the exist SHA-512 implementations as the 
&gt; reference platform: ( 
&gt; <a href="http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~sha3/ethz_gmu_sha3.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~sha3/ethz_gmu_sha3.pdf</a> ) 65nm, 1.08 V, 
&gt; 316 MHz.
&gt; 
&gt; The SHA-512 compression function has latency 65 cycles and
&gt; consumes 9 mW at this platform. As a result, 2^20 calls to the
&gt; SHA-512 compression function would take 9/(316/65) = 1.9mJ.w

My Catena ASIC attack uses GDDR5 external memory because doing the
full Blake2b hashing rounds is so slow that I can interleave a bunch
of password states in external memory, taking advantage of predictable
addressing, to nearly eliminate cache-miss penalties.  I get to run on
the order of the full memory bandwidth of 384GiB/s, to 16 banks of
GDDR5.  This greatly increases my attack rate vs doing hashing in cache.

The power for moving that data back and forth to/from DRAM will
dominate over the tiny power you're computing.  Even if I dramatically
slowed down my ASIC attack and did it all on-chip in cache, then a 9X
increase in computations would cause a 9X increase in runtime, with
the chip running at nearly full power.  Rapid read/writes to a large
cache like 8MiB will probably dominate over Blake2b computation power.

I don't think my ASIC with external GDDR5 attack will burn 70W, like
my Intel CPU, but as a total WAG, I'd guess it would burn half that,
which is in line with what the GDDR5 memory would burn as well.  That
stuff runs hot, but gives you 24GiB/s of bandwidth per bank.

&gt; Catena-3 with 128 MB of memory would need 2^21 64-byte SHA blocks, 
&gt; so 2^23 compression function calls, i.e. 15mJ within
&gt; 8/(316/65)=1.5 seconds. Our tradeoffs have computational penalty
&gt; 3.75q for the memory reduction by q, so, for instance, running it
&gt; with 16 MB of memory would require 30x more energy, or 450mJ within
&gt; the same 1.5 seconds.

No one is suggesting using Catena in it's submitted for for 128MiB
hashes.  The authors suggested 10MiB, I think, and since I only have
8MiB of cache, I benchmarked at either 4MiB or 8MiB.

&gt; The memory will consume far larger. The 128-MB Catena-3 
&gt; reads/writes 768 MB of data from/to RAM, and 1.5 GB in tradeoffs. 
&gt; If we consider GDDR5, advocated by Bill, and scale it down to 300 
&gt; MHz, it would at least consume 0.5W, so its energy consumption 
&gt; would be 750mJ, and 94mJ for 16MB.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, the attacker will reduce his costs even if the memory
&gt; is reduced 8-fold. And we have not counted the retention energy
&gt; yet, as it will raise the tradeoff efficiency even more.
&gt; 

Reducing memory by half means my ASIC attack could use 8GiB per bank
instead of 16GiB per bank.  That would cut the power, but not in half!
 Probably not even a quarter.  On the other hand, my bandwidth would
increase about 9X, causing me to run 9X longer, since I'm mostly
bandwidth limited.

There is simply no way that a TMTO is going to lower power in an ASIC
attack, unless it is a weak ASIC attack, or the algorithm has weak
TMTO resistance.  Did you consider an interleaved memory attack to
eliminate cache miss penalties for an attacker?  Also, did you
consider realistic memory sizes, closer to 8MiB?

Because of the predictable addressing, an attacker will pipeline the
snot out of memory access, and the Blake2b computations only provide
so much compute-time hardness.  That ASIC is going to need a great big
fan, and it is going to tear through 8MiB Catena hashes.

I'd put more work into it, but I don't believe Catena will "win"
anything with it's current very slow hashing.  I think once we plug
something like Lyra2's reduced round Blake2b into it, preferably with
the new multiplication chain hardening suggested by Samuel Neves, then
Catena will be far more ASIC resistant, and will hash 1GiB easily.
That's a completely different ASIC analysis, so I'd rather not put to
much effort into attacking Catena as-is.

Anyway, I'll start taking your analysis seriously when power at least
points in the right direction with a TMTO.  In the meantime, I've made
my guestimate for an ASIC attack against Catena.  It should be
factor-of-2-ish of reality for that specific attack.
