&gt; 
&gt; This isn't implemented yet, is it?

No, not yet. :-)


&gt;&gt; For the sake of of simplification, it is likely that we switch to
&gt;&gt; Blake2b-CTR encryption.
&gt; 
&gt; For CTR mode, it is critical to have unique nonce for each hash 
&gt; encrypted in this way.

I know, this the reason why we introduced a the first nonce-misuses
resistant on-line authenticated encryption scheme, namely McOE, in 2011.

&gt;  Where would it come from (would you simply reuse
&gt; the salt?) and how would you guarantee it is unique (normally, it is not
&gt; nearly as critical for 100% of salts to be unique, although indeed this
&gt; is our goal anyway)?


Our "Keyed Password Hashing" approach requires n-bit nonce consist not
of the salt, but of a 64-bit (unique) user id (uuid) padded 64 zero bits
(0^{64}), \ie nonce = uuid || 0^{64}.  Thus, nonce reuse is not an issue
at all. Furthermore, it also works fine with a constant salt value.


&gt; I've been thinking of including a similar feature into escrypt (to allow
&gt; for the secret key to be changed, which isn't possible with a mere local
&gt; parameter included in hashing), but I felt we'd need a block cipher (and
&gt; not turn it into a stream cipher with CTR mode or the like) to avoid the
&gt; issue mentioned above.  Not wanting to depend on an extra crypto
&gt; primitive (unless we'd be building on top of a block cipher anyway,
&gt; which is unlikely), my thoughts even went as far as building a Feistel
&gt; network on top of whatever crypto hash would need to be in the source
&gt; tree anyway (if scrypt compatibility mode is maintained, it'd likely be
&gt; SHA-256). 

A Feistel cipher with keyed SHA-256 as round function sounds fine to me.


&gt; Obviously, this doesn't make me happy.  I was just toying
&gt; with these ideas, without having arrived at a good builtin solution yet.
&gt; Extra dependency on salts uniqueness is bad.

It is not a major drama since the salt should always be a unique value.


&gt; Dependency on an extra crypto primitive for just this little thing is
&gt; bad (can as well not have the feature built in, then). 

Right. It is not a very sound solution, but better than nothing. :-)


&gt;&gt; IMHO we can assume that an adversary that has access to your password
&gt;&gt; hashes has also access to your key.

&gt; This will vary.  For example, a database backup dump may get compromised
&gt; without a corresponding compromise of the web server's config files.

Sure you are right. I only want to point out that the following
assumption is a strong one: adversary has *ONLY* access to the password
hashes, but no access to the key.


&gt; If we could achieve "perfect security", then sure it'd make sense to
&gt; assume only the worst case scenario and focus solely on that.  However,
&gt; we can't, so it makes sense to consider a variety of scenarios.

Unfortunately, we do not have formal security notions so far. This makes
it quite hard to design a secure scheme. I hope that due to the PHC we
can agree to a set of reasonable security notions.

BTW. Colin did an amazing good job in introducing the notion of
(sequential-)memory hardness.


Best regards,
Christian
