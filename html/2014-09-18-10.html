&gt; descrypt, bcrypt, and scrypt all have theoretical timing attacks,

&gt;
&gt; I believe a timing attack that actually reveals the password is
&gt; pretty far-fetched. The best you can probably hope for is leaking
&gt; some information that enables early-reject for offline attacks,
&gt; and that's provided you have the hash+salt in addition to the side
&gt; channel. And if an attacker only has the side channel and doesn't
&gt; have the salt, the side channel attack is largely irrelevant.

The lack of decline in offline attacks against descrypt, bcrypt, and scrypt
indicates that it's cheaper/easier to do than to use a timing attack. A
goal of this contest is to improve upon these algorithms' offline attack
resistance.  If this improvement is wildly successful then it could become
cheaper/easier to use a timing attack or other side-channel. Thus, it's
probably worth having a side-channel resistant portion to a design, as long
as the design as a whole is sufficiently strong against offline attacks and
adding the resistant portion does not compromise security elsewhere.

Agreed.  The current state of the art doesn't have good timing defense, and
has some weaknesses to offline attacks (eg low-memory scrypt on GPUs.) A
stronger but non-timing resistant algorithm would still be an improvement:
timing and other side-channel attacks will still be expensive/difficult to
pull off, and the overall success of password cracking should go down. A
timing-resistant first loop just provides security against a possible
future attack type. That's good to have, but not strictly necessary the way
offline attack resistance is.
