&gt; I found two bugs in your reference code:

&gt; +   value += mem[(2 * p + 1) * (uint64) numblocks * blocklen - 1];
&gt; I'm assuming this is a bug since the original is using the last int in the
&gt; first
&gt; block. Which is known early on.

Thanks for finding these!  I'm using your suggested fix for the 1st
one, and thinking of just initializing the second loop with value == 1
like the first.  Do you think that would be OK?

&gt; I also did some analysis of the access patterns. To build the first half
&gt; with
&gt; hashWithoutPassword() you only need 31% to 25% in active memory of that
&gt; half.

This is normal for "pure" KDFs that do no password derived memory
addressing.  The DAG size can always be pebbled without recomputations
in 1/2 memory (of the first half), for fanout degree &lt;= 2, and it can
be done efficiently with few recomputations at the 1/3 mark, and
typically the penalty isn't bad at the 25% mark.  The 1/8th mark is
where they seem to get hammered with punishing recomputations.

The second loop is meant to force the attacker to show they have all
the memory from the first pass at once.  I wont be able to detect if
they've skimped on memory for the first loop, but they'll need to show
it for the second.  This creates the possibility for one guess to be
doing the first loop, and another to be doing the second, sharing the
available memory more efficiently.  This would be about a 37.5% memory
reduction for "free", though there's additional complexity and some
recomputation.  This may be a generic issue with "hybrid" KDFs.

&gt; If you don't want to regenerate data. Also you don't need to store 8.67% to
&gt; 10.94% of the total memory because these are not required in the first half.
&gt; Since only 35.03% to 35.27% of the lookups from the second half are in the
&gt; first
&gt; half, regeneration of these will be minimal. Also if you have four times as
&gt; many
&gt; pebbles in the second half than the first. Obviously you would start with
&gt; them
&gt; all in the first half then move them over to the second half. Which has an
&gt; added
&gt; benefit because near the start of the second half it is much more likely
&gt; (80.16%
&gt; 1 MiB to 98.03% 1024 MiB) to do a lookup in the first half. Then drops to
&gt; 20.63%
&gt; chance that it will do a lookup in the first half.
&gt; I still need to do more but this is just what caught my eye.
&gt; Best I got is 8.67% to 10.94% reduction in memory for on average 3.06% to
&gt; 3.86%
&gt; more time.

That's a 7-ish% reduction in memory*time.  The best I'd done so far
was 3%, but I was trying to keep less memory in the second loop near
the end.  Combined, I suspect we could save 10% on memory*time.  It's
not ideal, but I don't know how to defend better against it other than
doing more read/write operations, losing significantly more than 10%.

Nice work on the math!

&gt; *** End ***
&gt;
&gt; Now for the new stuff:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; xorIntoHash() needs to be replaced preferably with a cryptographic hash that
&gt; uses more than the last hash's size bytes of data. You can reverse a 256 bit
&gt; non-parallel hash to on average 3 bits of the state in "mem" 7 steps prior
&gt; through hashBlocks()'s "fromAddr". Also 6 bits from 6 prior, 9 bits from 5
&gt; prior, 12 bits from 4 prior, ..., 21 bits from 1 prior, and 256 bits from
&gt; the
&gt; last block.

Did you notice that wordHash is initialized as the PBKDF2-SHA256 of
the password and salt?  If I simply XOR-ed the results of the memory
hashing together, that would be a problem, but since wordHash starts
out life as indistinguishable from true random data, XOR-ing lower
quality memory hashes into it cannot damage it's quality.

I may be unfamiliar with the attack you are referring to, but I don't
think there is an issue here.

Thanks for all the work on analysis!  If I'm misunderstanding your XOR
point, please set me straight.  All in all, I'm feeling pretty good...
an analysis of the level you've done could have been a lot more brutal
:-)

Bill
