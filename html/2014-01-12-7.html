That might be an improvement.  I guess matrix multiplies would be good
for machines with large vector processors.  I don't know how much
vector processing hardware our CPUs have, but I doubt it's enough to
justify the additional complexity.  Security is partly about the KISS
rule, I think.

Generally, people refer to me as a "router guy."  I've written a lot
of routers to connect stuff on chips.  One mistake I see over and over
when people come up with ideas for improving the speed of computation
is forgetting to take the routing penalties into account.  For
example, data flow machines would have dominated decades ago if not
for data routing delays.

Our CPUs are stuck with tremendous routing delays that just don't
exist on an ASIC when computing our inner-loops.  Any attempt to
protect passwords with computation-limited inner loops is not going to
get us very far.

If I really wanted to force an attacker to have a nice expensive CPU
like mine, I would fill instruction memory with pseudo-random
instructions.  Java is everywhere, so we could generate a megabyte of
bytecode in a way that we know it will execute a certain number of
hashing instructions before returning a hash result.  An attacker
would have to execute the code to make a password guess, and there's
no way he's going to execute that code faster than an Intel or AMD
CPU.  That would destroy his speed advantage, and we could still
hammer memory to reduce his cost advantage.  That would be awesome.

However, that complicates the algorithm dramatically, hurts
portability, and brings all the security holes in Java to our password
KDF.  I think the security experts' heads would explode if we tried to
standardize such a KDF.

I think the next significant layer of protection after off-chip memory
should be using GPUs for KDF.  Most smart phones and likely all future
desktop and laptop CPUs have significant GPU hardware, and we could
use that in parallel with hashing external memory.  That's why I think
a KDF should be designed with an adjustable parallelism parameter.
