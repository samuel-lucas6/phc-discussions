Subject: Re: [PHC] Do we need a common password hashing API?

Hey Alexander!

Before throwing the baby out with the bathwater I would suggest getting in
touch with Casper and Darren who are still at that company and might be
able to give you some insight into the patent. I left Sun in 2009 when Sun
got bought out, but back then the plan was to make it patented but not
enforced, ie: to stop some bad guy doing the same and blocking out the
Internet community.

Evidence of this would include that the SHA512 process borrows some ideas
from SunMD5 ("rounds=N" in the cipher, etc) because Casper (if I remember
correctly?) participated in that process with RedHat.

 I'll cc: them on this mail. I don't know whether if then reply whether it
would bounce?

&gt; Now that I've got all the entries linking with the PHS API, I wonder if it
&gt; would be useful to provide the world with a real one, something they could
&gt; actually use in their applications.  If I were developing an application
&gt; right now that needed to hash passwords, I'd like to future-proof my code
&gt; by linking against an "official" API, which would allow me to select an
&gt; established hashing algorithm now (like Bcrypt, Script, PBKDF2, or HKDF),
&gt; and easily switch in the future, after PHC winners are announced.
&gt;
&gt; Such an API would need some more parameters than the PHS API, such as the
&gt; hashing algorithm (like PBKDF2), a PRF (like SHA256), and a boolean flag
&gt; saying whether it's OK for the algorithm to clear the password.  We might
&gt; also want an additional data field, or maybe even a generic interface that
&gt; would allow users to hash as much data as they like, similar to the
&gt; init/update/final APIs.  Maybe it would be good to have something for
&gt; dealing with salt and settings string generation, similar to what
&gt; Pufferfish has.  The easier we can make life for users, the better.
&gt;


...and further...

&gt; Where's the huge warning that Sun/Oracle has patented this stuff, making
&gt; it unsuitable for the PHC community? ;-(  While there's prior art for most
&gt; or all of it (including my crypt_gensalt() on Owl), I think we should
&gt; stay away from the dynamic linking because of the patent, until it expires.

&gt;
&gt; Bill, here's a description of my crypt_gensalt(), etc., introduced into
&gt; Owl slightly earlier than Solaris' use of the same function name (year
&gt; 2000 vs. slightly later):
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://www.openwall.com/crypt/openwall-crypt.3.pdf">http://www.openwall.com/crypt/openwall-crypt.3.pdf</a>
&gt;
&gt; Besides the different function prototype and several other differences,
&gt; the major difference is in that my crypt_gensalt() accepts prefix
&gt; (requesting a particular hashing scheme) and iteration count as an
&gt; arguments, whereas Solaris' crypt_gensalt() reads the equivalents of
&gt; these (and possibly more) from a system-wide configuration file.  In
&gt; practice, the iteration count for my crypt_gensalt() is passed via
&gt; pam_tcb's command line found in system configuration files anyway, but
&gt; other uses are possible as well.
&gt;
&gt; So these differ in the kind of flexibility they provide.  In my case,
&gt; it's no dependence of this interface on system-wide configuration.
&gt; In Solaris' case, it's no dependence on there being just these two
&gt; parameters, so it's easier (or rather more consistent) to add m_cost and
&gt; any hashing scheme specific parameters.  These can be added via a
&gt; configuration file with my crypt_gensalt() too, but it becomes
&gt; inconsistent (t_cost is passed to the function, but m_cost, etc. is
&gt; somehow read by the function from files).
&gt;
&gt; Maybe yet another interface is desirable, where crypt_gensalt() would
&gt; accept an arbitrary set of parameters for the hashing scheme, and if
&gt; those are not provided then read them from a configuration file.
&gt;
&gt; As to the name=value encoding in salt strings (which I dislike), I think
&gt; it's orthogonal in this context.  Whether the encoding is verbose and
&gt; human-readable (such as the name=value stuff) or compact and
&gt; machine-focused (such as what I intend to use for yescrypt), there's a
&gt; need for an interface to produce those strings from the individual
&gt; parameter values.  e.g. yescrypt_gensalt() does that, and it accepts a
&gt; yescrypt-specific set of parameters.  This is fine for any particular
&gt; hashing scheme, but for a more generic crypt_gensalt() function the set
&gt; of possible parameters would need to vary by the requested hashing scheme.
&gt;
&gt; Alexander
