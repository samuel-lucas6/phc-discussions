&gt; Hi, Jacob.  This is a nice analysis.

Hi Bill,

Thank you!

&gt; You misread TwoCats.  It is easy to do, which is one reason I wrote
&gt; SkinnyCat, which indeed is vulnerable to both GC and WGC attacks. 
&gt; However, TwoCats has strong defense against both.  I would argue that
&gt; TwoCats has the strongest GC and WGC defense of all the entries.

The attacks for skinnycat are clear. For twocats, we totally agree that
it is strong against GC attacks (we just misread that the early memory
within twocats is always overwritten). But, regarding WGC attacks, we
still see the attack as described in the paper. According to our
definition of a Weak Garbage-Collector Attack an algorithm is
vulnerable, if it maintains a function $F$ with $y = F(pwd)$, where the
value $y$ is later used in the hashing process. Thus, $y$ has to remain
in memory during the time until it is used again at the end.

For twocats (and skinnycat), the value $y$ is given by PRK, which is
initialized with the password. PRK is later used in the function
addIntoHash(PRK, state). Thus, it has to remain in memory and can be
used by a WGC adversary to filter password candidates as described in
the paper.

Did we misunderstood something?

&gt; By default, Catena runs with minGarlic == maxGarlic == 18.  In this
&gt; mode, Catena does not begin to overwrite memory derived from the
&gt; password until it has finished filling memory.  During this entire time,
&gt; H(H(key material)) is present in memory.  If Catena tries to use too
&gt; much memory, this memory might get swapped to disk.  If Catena is
&gt; running continuously, as it might on an authentication server, with
&gt; lambda == 3, there is about a 1 in 4 chance that a cold-boot attack, DMA
&gt; attack, or forced hibernation, will reveal H(H(key material)).
&gt; 

For Catena-BRG, this is indeed an attack which succeeds with a chance of
$1/(lambda+1)$. Thanks for pointing this out! We will recommend to use
Catena-BRG with MinGarlic = 1 in the next version of our submission
paper to thwart this attack.

When considering Catena-DBG (our new instance using a double-butterfly
graph), such an attack succeeds only with probability of
	1/((lambda*2(logn-2))+2logn-1),
which leads to a much stronger resistance in this case. Therefore, we
plan to recommend MinGarlic = 1 for Catena-BRG and MinGarlic=MaxGarlic
for Catena-DBG. What do you think?

Best regards,
Jakob (on behalf of the CATENA design team)
