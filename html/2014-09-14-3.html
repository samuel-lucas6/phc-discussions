Subject: Re: [PHC] Makwa is broken given p and q

Sorry for taking so long I got scared by the long message *ashamed*. Anyway I
wrote down my thoughts on improving Makwa and arguing points. So I thought I
should read and reply to this first.

&gt; &gt; I was picking an absurd number to prove a point that apparently was

&gt;
&gt; It IS secure -- I am just going to the end of the logic.
&gt;
&gt; The CFP called for a desirable feature (among others): "For example, one
&gt; may design a scheme that is slow to evaluate except on a server given
&gt; some server-specific shortcut."
&gt;
&gt; It so happens that if such a "shortcut" exists, then it can be
&gt; leveraged, by definition, into a much faster attack. The whole core
&gt; assumption of PHC and password-hashing functions is that dictionary
&gt; attacks work, which is why we cannot just use a simple MD5 and be done
&gt; with it. I am then following that idea to its unavoidable conclusion: if
&gt; a "shortcut" exists, then it is almost equivalent to a free password
&gt; recovery for whoever can use it. So I am calling it "escrow" because
&gt; that's what it is.
&gt;

I'm confused I thought escrow and fast path were different. Also I don't believe
that fast path is an escrow. In your paper, page 12, you have a table that says
that escrow is not possible with pre-hashing and/or post hashing. Either you
need to fix that or escrow and fast path are different. Also I remember from
your Passwordcon14 talk that you purposely had the password in plaintext before
squaring for escrow. So that you can get access to the original password.


&gt; If you think of the shortcut (or "fast path") as a kind of escrow, then
&gt; the correct terminology is that of asymmetric encryption. A password
&gt; hashing function with a possible shortcut really is deterministic
&gt; asymmetric encryption:
&gt;
&gt; - If you don't know the private key, you can still encrypt the
&gt; password. To _verify_ a password, you also encrypt it, and check that
&gt; you get the same value -- that's the point of the encryption being
&gt; deterministic.
&gt;

Yeah, I've done this with a Teensy doing AES-CBC-CTS encrypt to prevent a leaked
database from being able to be cracked. I called it "JustEncrypt".


&gt; - If you do know the private key, then you can decrypt, which is all the
&gt; escrow or shortcut that you may need.
&gt;

Now that's an escrow... shortcut? Oh decrypt then compare password or oh. Did
you mean something like:
"If you do know the private key you can use a short cut and escrow the password
since you can decrypt."


&gt; &gt; I stand corrected, not broken, but my opinion is this is bad.
&gt;
&gt; There IS one bad thing: as explained above, if you don't want to hear
&gt; about any escrow or shortcut, and be sure that nobody can ever access
&gt; the p and q factors, then you must "forget" them just after having
&gt; generated them and multiplied them together to compute the modulus. This
&gt; is easy enough to do (the generation tools provided with the reference
&gt; implementations of Makwa do just that), but there is no way to do it
&gt; _convincingly_.
&gt;
&gt; By this I mean that though I can generate a modulus, I have no method to
&gt; convince _you_ that I did not keep the p and q factors around. This is a
&gt; problem for which cryptography has not yet found a reasonable solution
&gt; (there is a published construction, but it results in a very large
&gt; modulus). If such a method was known, I would have applied it, and it
&gt; would have resulted in a modulus that could be hardcoded and used
&gt; everywhere in the whole world.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore, I turned to the next best thing, which is custom modulus
&gt; generation. That is, if you want a modulus such that you are sure that
&gt; the p and q factors have not been saved anywhere, then just generate it
&gt; yourself. It will be your own modulus. It can be used for hashing all
&gt; the passwords of people who trust YOU.
&gt;

That's the problem if you tell people it's secure and that you can have a high
cost to attackers while having a low cost to you. People will keep p and q to do
fast path. Basically you can't say "you can keep p and q" to users and tell
critics "well just clear p and q and your issues go away [along with some
features]".
