Subject: Re: [PHC] yescrypt pre- and post-hashing

Regarding yescrypt's pre-hashing, which in the previous submission was:

	if (flags || t) {
		SHA256_CTX ctx;
		SHA256_Init(&amp;ctx);
		SHA256_Update(&amp;ctx, passwd, passwdlen);
		SHA256_Final((uint8_t *)sha256, &amp;ctx);
		passwd = (uint8_t *)sha256;
		passwdlen = sizeof(sha256);
	}

and existed to deal with the HMAC/PBKDF2 peculiarity where SHA-256 of a
65+ characters long password is plaintext-equivalent for that password.

This was believed to be just a peculiarity with no security impact.
Well, due to a recent tweet/reminder by Juliano Rizzo, I no longer think
so.  There was real security impact, even if in obscure cases.

Specifically, if a site upgrades from raw SHA-256 to e.g. scrypt hashes
(by re-hashing passwords as users log in), but does not securely wipe
all copies of the SHA-256 hashes from all places, then for the (few) 65+
char passwords those hashes can be used to log in to the service,
without the attacker ever having to crack the plaintext passwords.  This
was Juliano's original concern.

I came up with two more:

Even without a hash type upgrade by any site, some of the users
themselves may have reused passwords across multiple sites.  If one or
more of those sites uses (or used) raw SHA-256, then hashes leaked from
there (or abused by the site's admins) can be used to log in to sites
that use scrypt - yes, for 65+ char passwords only.

So far, these attacks are mitigated by yescrypt's pre-hashing above.
That's because the site using yescrypt would apply SHA-256 once again,
regardless of password length, so a pre-existing SHA-256 hash would not
be usable to log in (it would have SHA-256 applied twice, resulting in
no match for the final hash value).

However (and that's my second attack, or third one counting from Juliano's):

What if (ye)scrypt is used as a KDF, and someone reuses the same
passphrase for logging in to a site that uses raw SHA-256 and for
encrypting some data (e.g., a backup dump or a filesystem)?  Or what if
a remote site itself uses (ye)scrypt to derive the keys for encrypting
users' data at rest from their login passwords, and either the same site
or any other site (where password reuse by the users could occur) ever
used raw SHA-256 for password hashes used for authentication?  Then,
despite of yescrypt's mitigation above, the full yescrypt derived keys
may be computed from the SHA-256 hashes!  Sure, raw SHA-256 might have
made it easy to crack the plaintext password anyway... but some
percentage of passwords (not very large, but not negligible either)
would withstand some offline attacks on their raw SHA-256 hashes.

So we had 3 somewhat practically relevant problems with this in scrypt,
and we still have 1 of them in yescrypt as previously submitted to PHC.

Here's how I intend to fix this now:

	if (flags) {
		HMAC_SHA256_CTX ctx;
		HMAC_SHA256_Init(&amp;ctx, "yescrypt", 8);
		HMAC_SHA256_Update(&amp;ctx, passwd, passwdlen);
		HMAC_SHA256_Final((uint8_t *)sha256, &amp;ctx);
		passwd = (uint8_t *)sha256;
		passwdlen = sizeof(sha256);
	}

&gt; &gt; In particular, is it a good idea to enable this on any (other) deviation
&gt; &gt; from classic scrypt, without requiring that this feature itself be
&gt; &gt; requested explicitly?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think it's important to be able to use this feature while
&gt; everything else remains Script compatible.  The password collision
&gt; problem hasn't seemed to be a problem in the wild so far, and if a
&gt; user is going to upgrade his password hashing scheme, I'd hope he'd
&gt; consider using some of your other features, and not just this one.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I would prefer to specify if I want script compatibility, and
&gt; if I say I don't need it, then then this should be enabled, along with
&gt; any other improvement.

Given new concerns above, I am changing yescrypt to enable the
mitigation above even if most of the other deviations from classic
scrypt are disabled.  Specifically, I am making this mitigation usable
even with t = 0 in YESCRYPT_WORM mode.  That way, this will be trivial
to adopt (as a tiny subset of yescrypt) by existing implementations of
scrypt, with very little code to add.

I think scrypt is very good, and I think there are some use cases for
its deliberate TMTO-friendliness.  I'd like to give the (almost) classic
scrypt a new life by making it a potential PHC winner, as one of the
modes in / subsets of yescrypt.

It will remain possible (in yescrypt) to compute classic scrypt hashes
(without the mitigation above) as well, but for compatibility only.  The
new way of requesting these is:

flags = 0 means classic scrypt
YESCRYPT_WORM means very slight deviation from classic scrypt
YESCRYPT_RW means full native yescrypt

&gt; I think your solution to the collision problem is cool.  You fixed the
&gt; biggest drawback of how HMAC is used in PBKDF2, as if you'd simply
&gt; gone in and deleted the offending if statement and forced SHA256 to
&gt; always be called on the password.  You added a line to effectively
&gt; delete one.

Yes.  But I no longer like it that much, because of the issue with mixed
raw SHA-256 and yescrypt KDF use.  So it will likely be gone in today's
last-minute submission of yescrypt tweaks.

&gt; &gt; 2. Ability to upgrade raw SHA-256 hashes, which unfortunately are in use
&gt; &gt; by some sites, to yescrypt hashes.  The specific choice of SHA-256 is
&gt; &gt; simply because it's used in (ye)scrypt anyway, but it happens to be
&gt; &gt; somewhat relevant for such upgrades.  Indeed, this sort of upgrades are
&gt; &gt; always possible, but now for raw SHA-256's the resulting hashes would be
&gt; &gt; genuine yescrypt hashes, with no need to record that they've been
&gt; &gt; upgraded from raw SHA-256.  (For upgrading anything else to yescrypt,
&gt; &gt; such info would still need to be recorded.)
&gt; 
&gt; By raw SHA-256 hashes, do you mean just a hash of the password,
&gt; without even salt?  I'm sure this is how many people store passwords.
&gt; It's probably the second most common technique after just storing the
&gt; password as plain text.

Yes, that's what I meant, and yes raw SHA-256 is somewhat common (maybe
less so than raw MD5, though).  Unfortunately, this nice property has to
go, because we can't keep it in yescrypt while also allowing for safe KDF
use of yescrypt when there might be raw SHA-256 hashes of the same
passwords out there.  Well, I could introduce yet another flag and have
it enabled when yescrypt is called via a password hashing rather than a
KDF interface, but I'd better not introduce hacks like that.
