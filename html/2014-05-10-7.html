Subject: Re: [PHC] PHS API copyright?

Even though no one in their right mind would consider the signature
declaration to be copyrightable if the Oracle v. Google appeal ruling
stands it will be. A public-domain like license is probably the best bet,
since some countries don't allow works to be placed in the public domain.

&gt; I think having clear copyright and statements on the PHS and the site
&gt; materials are good things to do.  They keep everything clear.
&gt;
&gt; In my response to Bill Cox, I was thinking of the copyright on
&gt; submissions, not on the PHS signature declaration.
&gt;
&gt; Also, a derivative header file where the parameters to PHS are made more
&gt; specific and explicit would count as a separate work although the new
&gt; copyright does not extend over the borrowed parts.  The additional material
&gt; is subject to separate copyright.
&gt;
&gt; I am also not worried about the PHS signature and the specification of it
&gt; given as part of the PHC.  That is not legal advice, of course.  Just the
&gt; same, it is good practice to be clear what the copyright license conditions
&gt; are, even if a work were eventually deemed not copyrightable.  Honoring the
&gt; conditions is simply the safe thing to do.

&gt;
&gt; I would not worry about the IP on the PHS API.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW, the PHS API consists of only one function prototype specified on
&gt; <a href="https://password-hashing.net/call.html" rel="nofollow">https://password-hashing.net/call.html</a>
&gt;
&gt; That prototype was agreed upon by a subset of the panel members,
&gt; including myself. As copyright holders, I think we will all agree to
&gt; license it to anyone under public domain-like terms (CC0, Unlicense,
&gt; etc.).
&gt;
&gt; That said, I believe it is necessary to clarify intellectual property
&gt; terms on the PHC website. I will discuss this with qualified people,
&gt; and will add the relevant statements to the website. Hopefully next
&gt; week.

&gt; &gt; Yes, Software did not have copyright until the 1976 revision of the
&gt; &gt; Copyright code.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The original expression (not the part that is from another source) in all
&gt; &gt; software is a copyrighted work the minute it is put in tangible form.  So
&gt; &gt; the original part of your PHS contribution is already copyright by you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Those BSD and GPL notices incorporated in files do not change their
&gt; &gt; copyright status, they simply prescribe the allowable use by offering an
&gt; &gt; automatic license that is available so long as the terms and conditions
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; honored.  I don't know what you put in the headings of your files, but if
&gt; &gt; you want to be clear, it is important to be explicit about what the
&gt; &gt; automatic license is to be, if any.  And if you have made a derivative of
&gt; &gt; (parts of) other work, the licenses on those works must be honored by
&gt; you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For the most part, programs are used the way their authors intended and
&gt; &gt; there is no harm and no foul.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What we're seeing here is a dispute among two commercial actors.  Oracle
&gt; &gt; certainly wants people to use their "API" (as clarified by the court
&gt; &gt; concerning what "API" is in the context of Java).  Oracle claims
&gt; commercial
&gt; &gt; harm in the resultant "fork."  Apparently, the OpenJDK license was not
&gt; &gt; something Google was willing to honor.  We'll see how it goes when the
&gt; &gt; fair-use question is retried.

&gt; &gt; for an extensive account given in the ruling itself in the "Background"
&gt; &gt; section.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the link. I read: The jury found that Google infringed
&gt; Oracle's
&gt; &gt; copyrights in the 37 Java packages and a specific computer routine called
&gt; &gt; "rangeCheck,"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oracle succeeded in copyrighting their API.  Had this happened in the
&gt; days
&gt; &gt; of Unix, God only knows what kind of computing we'd have today.
