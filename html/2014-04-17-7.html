Bill,

How did you calculate the "average memory/second" for Lyra2 and
yescrypt.  I don't know about Lyra2's, but yescrypt's looks wrong to me.

I think it is 5/8 of peak, since memory usage is growing linearly for
the first 3/4th of time, and then stays at peak for 1/4th.

&gt; &gt; Lyra2:
&gt; &gt; Peak memory/second: 1.63 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; Average memory/second: 1.22 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; Memory bandwidth: 11.4 GiB/s  (highly bandwidth limited)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yescript:
&gt; &gt; Peak memory/second: 3.03 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; Average memory/second: 2.27 GiB/s

This would be: 3.03*5/8 = 1.89 GiB/s

&gt; &gt; Memory bandwidth: 6.06 GiB/s (does it do 2 r/w to DRAM per location, or 3?)
&gt; 
&gt; yescrypt does 4 r/w per location when YESCRYPT_RW is set (and it is set

No, that's wrong: it's 2 r/w per iteration.  It would be 4 r/w per
location if SMix2 ran for as many iterations for SMix1, but in this mode
it does not.  I think correct is:

3.03 * 4/3 * 2 = 8.08 GiB/s

4/3 is ratio of number of iterations to number of locations
2 is number of r/w per iteration

&gt; in the PHS() API), so this would be 12.12 GiB/s.  It does one random
&gt; read and one sequential write per iteration in SMix1, and one random
&gt; read+write per iteration in SMix2.  (Resetting, YESCRYPT_RW brings it to
&gt; only 2 r/w per location like in normal scrypt, but then it'd have to run
&gt; 1.5 times longer to achieve optimal normalized area-time and it'd be
&gt; friendly to TMTO, hence that mode isn't the default.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; TwoCats:
&gt; &gt; Peak memory/second: 4.98 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; Average memory/second: 2.49 GiB/s
&gt; &gt; Memory bandwidth: 9.97 GiB/s
&gt; 
&gt; I'd interpret these as TwoCats and yescrypt winning over Lyra2 in terms
&gt; of average memory/second, which I think is the most important of three
&gt; metrics here.  yescrypt loses to TwoCats in terms of this metric by 8.9%,
&gt; but it possibly makes up for that by using 21.6% more memory bandwidth
&gt; (some would view that as a drawback, but in this test we were specifically
&gt; trying to use as much bandwidth from one thread as we could).

The 8.9% was based on your "average memory/second" figures.  With
yescrypt's corrected, TwoCats' advantage is 24%, which is impressive!

I am surprised that Lyra2 and TwoCats seem to win significantly in terms
of bandwidth usage.  I doubt it's the cost of one round of pwxform
(although to find out we can try making it zero rounds, even).  It could
be the cost of r=8.

&gt; BTW, chances are that going from r=8 to r=16 (already a tunable, like in
&gt; scrypt) would increase yescrypt's bandwidth usage (and average and peak
&gt; memory usage per second) some further.  I choose r=8 for PHS() because
&gt; it increases reliance on fast small random lookups.  r=32 and higher
&gt; might be faster or slower, since we're competing for L1 cache space with
&gt; pwxform's S-boxes (8 KiB in these tests).
