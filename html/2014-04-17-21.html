&gt; &gt; Actually an explanation would be really good, because I confess
&gt; &gt; that, except for "memory bandwidth", I'm not sure I understand
&gt; &gt; what those numbers mean or how to computed them...

&gt; Does the "memory bandwidth" figure for Lyra2 look correct to you,
&gt; given
&gt; the "time" output Bill posted?

Well, the "time" seems OK, although it is quite worse than what we got in our machine. The number "7" being multiplied by "Peak memory/second" eludes me, though. Each hashing operation in Lyra2 takes as input two memory locations ("prev" and "row*") and then its output is written to two memory locations ("row" and "row*). During Setup, "row" is just written over, while "row*" is XORed with the output (which may count as a "read"?); during the Wandering phase, both "row" and "row*" are XORed with the output. 

Am I missing something? The r/w on the "state" variable, maybe? 

&gt; As to peak and average memory usage "per second", they're
&gt; abstractions
&gt; obtained by dividing actual peak memory usage by actual running time
&gt; (for peak memory usage "per second") and averaging memory usage for a
&gt; hash computation over time and then dividing by the time it took to
&gt; compute a hash (for average memory usage "per second"). They are not
&gt; literally "per second", because they are for certain cost settings
&gt; that
&gt; don't result in a hash computation taking exactly one second and
&gt; because
&gt; they would not stay exactly the same for other cost settings.

&gt; Given this explanation, do these figures for Lyra2, as Bill posted
&gt; given
&gt; the "time" output, look correct to you?

&gt; Is it expected that Lyra2's average memory usage is 3/4 of peak?
&gt; I think Bill may have taken scrypt's ratio for these and applied it
&gt; to
&gt; Lyra2 and yescrypt, even though at least for yescrypt's native mode
&gt; with
&gt; t=0 it's wrong (maybe it's also wrong for Lyra2).

We did not test the algorithm using this metric, so I cannot say for sure. I will come back to this after some tests, but for now let's assume it is correct. 

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am surprised that Lyra2 and TwoCats seem to win significantly
&gt; &gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; terms
&gt; &gt; &gt; of bandwidth usage. I doubt it's the cost of one round of pwxform
&gt; &gt; &gt; (although to find out we can try making it zero rounds, even). It
&gt; &gt; &gt; could
&gt; &gt; &gt; be the cost of r=8.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is likely to have a relationship: we have a compile-time
&gt; &gt; parameter "nCols" that has a similar effect to scrypt's "r". It is
&gt; &gt; part of the algorithm's core rather than a "tweak", but it would
&gt; &gt; not fit in the PHS interface...

&gt; What did you set "nCols" to, and what does it correspond to in bytes?

&gt; [ye]scrypt's r=8 is 1 KiB.

nCols is set to 64 by default, which means that each row has 64*768 bits = 6144 bytes = 6 KiB. In our machine we got better results with nCols = 128 (12 KiB), though. Those are the figures we put in the specification.
