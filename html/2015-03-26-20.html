&gt; &gt; I need to go carefully read the latest version, but IIRC, Lyra2 still does
&gt; &gt; no small random reads in it's inner loop, right?  Once you get down to L1

&gt; &gt; GPUs are not good at.  While this may not always be true, currently GPUs
&gt; &gt; are very slow at doing rapid small unpredictable reads. 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, we did include in Lyra2's core the extension that would read
&gt; rapidly and unpredictably from rows prev^0 and prev^1 (that are likely
&gt; in in L1 cache), but sincerely we could not see much of a difference in
&gt; modern GPUs coming specifically from this reading pattern (even though
&gt; we did observe slowdowns in an older GPU). We decided to keep the tweak
&gt; anyway, however, because it makes pipelining between rows more
&gt; complicated to achieve, and also considering older GPUs. We did not test
&gt; this issue extensively, though, since we decided to keep the extension
&gt; anyway (maybe we should revisit that).

This sounds good.

For bcrypt-like GPU resistance, the memory accesses have to be rapid and
their available parallelism has to be low.  Maybe your accesses are not
rapid enough, or maybe they are.  If you were only testing at sizes like
2.3 MB as you mentioned, you might not have observed this effect fully
because at that size it was not yet needed for that GPU.  You should
also test on multiple GPU types.  For example, Kepler (which is what
you're using?) is very bad at bcrypt (several times slower than CPU so
far), but Maxwell and GCN are OK (CPU-like).  So defeating Kepler in
this way is easier, and this should not mislead you into thinking your
accesses are already rapid enough for all current GPUs.

&gt; Anyhow, I believe that more tests with (1) lower memory usages and (2)
&gt; different GPU-oriented techniques may help clarifying this point,
&gt; though, because so far we have no experimental data showing when Lyra2
&gt; starts being faster in GPUs than in CPUs.

Right.
