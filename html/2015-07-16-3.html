That's sad. The MSR paper you mention is probably

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Earlier this year, I became aware, from Jeremy Spilman, of 2 patents
&gt; that might (or might not, I am not a patent lawyer) apply to purposeful
&gt; use of yescrypt's ROM as a secret.  My understanding is that they do not
&gt; apply to uses of a ROM for port-hardness, which is what I am primarily
&gt; proposing it for.
&gt;
&gt; One of these patents is Jeremy's own on what he calls Blind Hashing,
&gt; already discussed in here.  (It made me pretty sad and angry at first,
&gt; as I think it's a good idea that is a pity to have taken away from the
&gt; larger community until the patent expires.  Also, obviously several
&gt; people were thinking of similar approaches, not just Jeremy.)
&gt;
&gt; IIRC, the Blind Hashing patent talks specifically about looking up extra
&gt; "salts", so it is unclear to me (not being a patent lawyer and not
&gt; having read the patent closely) if this language applies to simultaneous
&gt; use of a RAM and ROM like yescrypt does where no intermediate tiny value
&gt; (salt-like) is ever derived.  Hopefully not.  For upgraded hashes, with
&gt; g &gt; 0, there are obviously tiny intermediate values - the old,
&gt; pre-upgrade hashes.  I don't know if it fits under "salts" per that
&gt; patent or not.  But even if it does, it shouldn't apply when the ROM
&gt; isn't being used as a secret, but is used e.g. for port-hardness.
&gt;
&gt; The other patent, which I also haven't read closely, covers an idea
&gt; expressed in IIRC a Microsoft Research paper from several years ago.
&gt; In the paper, it's essentially the same idea Steve Thomas proposed
&gt; shortly before Passwords12 - a large ROM on a system connected at low
&gt; bandwidth just sufficient for defensive use but not for quickly
&gt; downloading the ROM.  (I don't have that paper reference handy at the
&gt; moment.  I may dig it up and post later, or Jeremy may.)
&gt;
&gt; In both cases, the number of lookups was intended to be low - just
&gt; sufficient to hopefully prevent at least 1 of them (in each one hash
&gt; computation) from completing when an attacker has only a portion of the
&gt; ROM (e.g. only 1/4 of it), for most candidate passwords tested.
&gt; In yescrypt's use of ROM, the number of lookups is a lot higher, as
&gt; needed to provide port-hardness.
&gt;
&gt; Overall, I feel these patents do not directly apply to yescrypt's ROM,
&gt; and not at all to its primary intended use, yet I felt I needed to post
&gt; about them in here.  I'd appreciate advice on whether/how to mention
&gt; related yet likely not directly applying patents like that in a revised
&gt; yescrypt specification document.
&gt;
&gt; Alexander
&gt;
