Subject: scripting memory (not so) high

Hi,

Attached is a PHP script implementing a sequential memory-hard KDF.
At this point, this is primarily an experiment to see how much memory
can be used in this fashion from scripting languages (with PHP being the
primary target) while maintaining run times suitable for web apps' user
authentication.

I am using SHA-512 as the crypto primitive for several reasons:

- It's possibly the fastest way to fill memory in PHP (other than with a
repeating pattern, which would be unsuitable), due to it producing 64
bytes per call.  (The interpreter overhead per byte produced is low.)

- It's strong crypto, so the same primitive is also usable to provide
the crypto properties of the KDF.  (No need to have two different
primitives, like scrypt's Salsa20/8 and SHA-256, which is its drawback.)

- It's widely available by now (although not as widely as MD5).

- It makes relatively good use of the CPU, even when invoked on just one
input (when no multi-input parallelism is available, like it is not with
the limited interfaces of scripting languages).  It uses 64-bit integers,
and moreover the message scheduling portion may be SIMD'ed.
(Unfortunately, it's not as efficient on 32-bit CPUs and in 32-bit mode
on x86 CPUs, although optimized implementations on the latter can access
64-bit operations via SSE2, using half the vector width - e.g., I think
OpenSSL's does.)

- It has relatively high registers*time cost internally, doubling both
the amount of processing and the required total size of fast registers -
thus, a total of 4x increase - as compared to SHA-256.  We're currently
seeing this sort of performance difference between SHA-512 and SHA-256
on GPUs (SHA-512 is typically 4x+ slower than SHA-256 on most GPUs, in
terms of hashes per second per chip).

- It's NIST-approved.  (This argument did arise in discussions around
Drupal 7's password hashing, and it switched to SHA-512 for the crypto
primitive specifically for this reason.)

- It's already in use by Drupal 7's revision of phpass, giving us a
performance baseline and easing migration of future Drupal to a possible
sequential memory-hard password hashing scheme also based on SHA-512.

The KDF structure is currently similar to scrypt's SMix, including its
TMTO susceptibility and indexing by secret.  (There's room for
improvement here, as discussed for the "native code" KDFs.)

The hard-coded parameter k controls the read block size used by the
second loop.  Lower k speeds things up, allowing us to increase m_cost
for the same target running time.  Higher k reduces interpreter
overhead, thereby reducing the gap between scripting and native code
implementations.  For the test results below, k is 4 (512-byte blocks).

Time to compute 10 hashes (sequentially) at 1 MiB each, on one CPU core
in different machines:

i7-4770K, 64-bit PHP build:

$ time php5 smhkdf.php 
S9PWB9zxGviqNY0vqBMAT2jg+dTYAzcF+GE7Wea1ajY=

real    0m0.567s
user    0m0.556s
sys     0m0.008s

FX-8120, 64-bit PHP build:

$ time php5 smhkdf.php 
S9PWB9zxGviqNY0vqBMAT2jg+dTYAzcF+GE7Wea1ajY=

real    0m1.055s
user    0m1.048s
sys     0m0.004s

Pentium 3, 1 GHz:

$ time php5-cli smhkdf.php 
S9PWB9zxGviqNY0vqBMAT2jg+dTYAzcF+GE7Wea1ajY=

real    0m13.410s
user    0m13.315s
sys     0m0.093s

This is 17.6 c/s on the fastest machine (on one core in it) and 0.75 c/s
on the slowest.

Running 8 concurrent instances, they complete in 1.18s on i7-4770K and
in 1.58s on FX-8120.  This gives 67.8 c/s and 50.6 c/s, respectively.

Are these numbers good enough?  I'm not sure.  They indicate pretty good
speed of computing SHA-512 for a CPU - almost as good as native (indeed,
setting k higher than 1 helps here: we get a native code loop around the
SHA-512 compression function).  We're computing (1+4)*16384 = 81920
SHA-512 compressions per call.  This corresponds to 5.5M (on i7-4770K)
or 4M (on FX-8120) SHA-512's per second.  This is only ~3x lower than
what a password cracker with SIMD code achieves on these CPUs.  Not bad
for a scripting language and our fairly low k (setting k higher than 4
improves efficiency somewhat further, but reduces memory usage per time).

However, if a web app install could reasonably handle more than 50
requests/s and no extra anti-DoS measures are being added along with the
move to slower password hashing like this, then the app may become more
susceptible to DoS.  Maybe lower m_cost or/and k should be used in those
cases.

For comparison, Drupal 7 was once using 16384 iterations of SHA-512, and
I think they've since moved to 32768.  Personally, I find these a bit
too high given the lower-than-native PHP code efficiency and considering
the DoS susceptibility, but maybe they know they have features that are
more attractive DoS targets anyway, in which case this is sort of fine. ;-)
(I think they have no per-source rate limiting or such.)  So apparently
32768 invocations of SHA-512 is considered an acceptable default by a
major web app now (although not by most other web apps).  In my tests
above, I also had 32768 invocations of SHA-512, but they correspond to
81920 invocations of the SHA-512 compression function.  Thus, this is up
to 2.5x slower - but less than that in practice because k&gt;1 results in
higher efficiency.  In practice this might be 1.5x slower than Drupal's
upgraded default of 32768.  Perhaps this will match Drupal developers'
desired amount of processing per hash computed by the time PHC is over,
and if not - and for other projects - lower settings may be used (e.g.,
512 KiB memory or less), which is probably still much better than having
no memory hardness at all (except for SHA-512's "built in" demand for
much register space).

Disclaimer: there may be bugs in the smhkdf code (e.g., some off-by-ones
are likely).  Implementations in other languages will be needed before
we can have much confidence in its correctness.  Besides, several
enhancements relative to scrypt's SMix structure may be implemented.
These possible errors and enhancements may affect smhkdf's performance,
although I expect its performance to stay within a factor of 2 of the
numbers given above.

Alexander
