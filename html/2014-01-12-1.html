&gt;&gt; On Sat, Jan 11, 2014 at 1:42 PM, Bill Cox &gt;&gt; Imagine that all the lines of code you've written in C for escrypt,
&gt;&gt;&gt; other than for memory access, will cost an attacker maybe $0.02 per
&gt;&gt;&gt; core, and that Salsa20/20 will run in maybe 2 clocks instead of 1 for
&gt;&gt;&gt; Salsa20/1.  This is roughly the case, within maybe 2X in cost and
&gt;&gt;&gt; clock cycles.  It's pointless trying to make an ASIC attacker's
&gt;&gt;&gt; arithmetic cost significant in either time or money, so we have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; focus on memory size and bandwidth.  For defense against ASIC attacks,
&gt;&gt;&gt; your Salsa20/1 benchmark is the best.  50GB/s!  Nice!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is this entirely true?  That is, I always thought that the fancy ALUs
&gt;&gt; on modern CPUs were big and expensive, and that they accounted for
&gt;&gt; non-negligible fractions of the cost.  If so, that would mean that a
&gt;&gt; good password hash should try to max them out.  There's also cache
&gt;&gt; size and bandwidth, and I assume that sticking really fast cache on an
&gt;&gt; ASIC is just as expensive as the really fast cache that already exists
&gt;&gt; on CPU dies.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it's really true.  Intel CPUs have an unbelievable amount of
&gt; logic on them, but I've always felt half or more of it is for
&gt; backwards compatibility.  Check out this NVIDIA ARM based ASIC die
&gt; picture:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://www.bdti.com/InsideDSP/2011/10/20/NvidiaQualcomm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bdti.com/InsideDSP/2011/10/20/NvidiaQualcomm</a>
&gt;
&gt; If you can find the ALUs, your eyes are better than mine!  The die is
&gt; 80-90% RAM (minus pad ring), and that's doing a lot of processing.
&gt; Can you find the multipliers?  They should be visible, but I didn't
&gt; see them.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; (I could be wrong here.  I've fiddled with high-end Virtex parts, but
&gt;&gt; I have no real concept of what ASIC logic costs.)
&gt;
&gt; You are right that cache on an ASIC is just as expensive (or more)
&gt; than on a CPU.  Hammering cache in a KDF is an excellent defense
&gt; against ASIC attacks.  However, you can't count on having a very low
&gt; cost*time multiplier when an ASIC does the whole attack on-chip
&gt; (nothing close to the 4-5X per ASIC vs Alexander's 50GB/s benchmark).
&gt; It can split that cache into 100 banks and the bandwidth can go
&gt; through the roof.  Think Terabytes per second.  In that case, your
&gt; best defense is that sequential inner loop, but like I said,
&gt; Salsa20/20 is likely only 2-ish clock cycles (maybe 1 or 4?), so
&gt; making the inner loop complex doesn't buy you much.  You'd still have
&gt; trouble finding that ALU vs the cache it's sitting next to.

To be clear, I was thinking about the possibility of hammering cache
and main memory at the same time.  Imagine some matrix multiplies or
other cache-heavy operations needed to select the next memory index to
access.  If you could get 30 or 40 GB/sec and, say, 100GB/sec to L2,
you'd probably be doing even better.  (No clue whether this is
possible -- I'm not at all sure whether modern CPUs can sustain that
much bandwidth anywhere.  Something that depends on low-latency access
to a block of cache might be a better bet.)
