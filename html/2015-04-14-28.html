&gt; 
&gt; I would like to comment on this as well, but I do not quite understand
&gt; how you measure the parallelism. Maybe the compression function
&gt; picture in Argon2 specification helps.

On the panel list, Samuel Neves has just convinced me that Argon2's
current parallelism isn't "insane" (as I had said there), but is merely
"not _that_ bad, particularly considering the near future" (as he said).

Specifically, Samuel provided some info and some well-reasoned guesses
as to how many BLAKE2b instances may be interleaved on current CPUs
while still achieving significant per-instance speed improvement, and
also some guesses as to what may be beneficial on AVX-512 with either
lane-slicing or word-slicing.  While I think this may be offset by
those CPUs' maybe-higher number of hardware threads per core (thereby
needing less parallelism within each thread), we are in fact getting to
within 1/4 or possibly even 1/2 of Argon2's 8x BLAKE2b parallelism.
So for those near future CPUs, it's excessive only by a factor of 2x to
4x, which I agree "is not that bad".  (For older CPUs, it's still pretty
awful, I'd say.)

Samuel, were you thinking just one thread per core, though?  I guess
with two threads/core on Haswell, BLAKE2b wouldn't need the 2 to 4
instances you mentioned (for reaching full speed, overall)?

I had been thinking too much in terms of pwxform, where the current
512-bit feels like the maximum we can have on current CPUs without
benefiting attackers too much.  In this context, Argon2's 8192-bit felt
insane.  But Argon2's isn't actually 8192-bit parallelism, since each
BLAKE2b has ILP of "only" around 4 (per Samuel) for 64-bit instructions
or SIMD lanes.  So it's more like 8 instances * 4 * 64-bit = 2048 bits.
Right?  2048 is still very high, compared to yescrypt's current 512, but
it isn't out of consideration for near future.

Also, I see how Argon2 kills a whole dimension of potential TMTO attacks
by its compression function design criteria, of which the parallelism is
a side-effect.  Without that, some non-trivial reasoning is needed to
see whether what the Argon2 paper calls an "iterative compression
function" ends up allowing for practical TMTO attacks on the whole
scheme or not, and what its highest reasonably TMTO-safe block size is.
