&gt;&gt;Will the submissions be designed so client-side assistance will be
&gt;&gt;practical?
&gt; 
&gt; Is client-side assistance without a secure tunnel ever practical ?
&gt; 
&gt; I spent a lot of time researching this some years back, and concluded
&gt; that it wasn't worth it.
&gt; 
&gt; It may be my lack of imagination, but every scheme I came up with,
&gt; required strong privacy for the connection, or the NSA[1] would be able
&gt; to deduce the password given a small-ish number of session taps.
&gt; 
&gt; Without going into too much detail, I don't think the salt should
&gt; be revealed to the client and the eavesdroppers, so we cannot involve
&gt; the client in anything from the point in the algorithm where the
&gt; salt is mixed in.

I think detail may well be warranted here - salt is a public parameter.

&gt; Any algorithm along the general scheme:
&gt; 
&gt; a = password
&gt; for i in N:
&gt; a = crypto_graphic_hash(a)
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; Would allow some fraction of N to be offloaded to the client, but this
&gt; is a lot less useful than you'd think.
&gt; 
&gt; If the number of rounds we ask the client to perform is constant,
&gt; a trivial replay is possible.
&gt; 
&gt; If we ask for a variable number of rounds, you can always use a
&gt; recorded session with a lower round-count to replay into a higher
&gt; asked-for round-count (hint: OPIE and S/KEY)
&gt; 
&gt; To work around that, we could ask the client to throw half the
&gt; entropy away:
&gt; 
&gt; a = password
&gt; for i in N:
&gt; a = crypto_graphic_hash(first_half_of(a))
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; If the hash were wide, something like SHA512, that *may* be defensible
&gt; behaviour:  Given the lack of entropy in real-world passwords, the
&gt; actual loss of entropy is limited, but it makes me feel very, very
&gt; uncomfortable doing so.
&gt; 
&gt; It should not be overlooked that the client and server do in fact
&gt; have a shared secret, even though the server does not keep it around
&gt; in readble form.

I think this is a key insight, but which isn't sufficiently leveraged by 
what you suggest. In particular, this is basically the same assumption an 
augmented PAKE makes - as I posted in another mail, SRP is a particularly 
instructive example of that, by providing a trivial construction that 
permits nearly-full server offload (you still have to do the SRP modular 
arithmentic) without requiring a secure channel (at least, it does if salt 
is considered a public parameter).

&gt; It would be possible to modify the above algorithm to something
&gt; like:
&gt; 
&gt; a = password
&gt; b = make_integer_from(cryptographic_hash(a)):
&gt; for i N + b:
&gt; a = cryptographic_hash(a)
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; And hand the client a random number X, and have it perform a
&gt; hardly predictable number of rounds, maybe ((X * b) mod (N + b)) or
&gt; similar.
&gt; 
&gt; The server would have to store b along with the password for this
&gt; to work.  The parameters can probably be tuned so that it only
&gt; leaves a real replay opening, if the server happens to ask for the
&gt; same X again.

&gt; But would it be worth the extra complexity ?
&gt; 
&gt; Only if you can *always* mandate client-assist, will there be any
&gt; benefit of the "make botnets work for it" type, and I think what
&gt; little benefit that might give is better handled by ratelimiting
&gt; attempts at the server side.

I disagree - this isn't an either/or proposition. In particular, I can see a 
good deal of value in having server-relief by optional under normal 
circumstances, but under high load (slashdotting, attempted DOS via 
expensive password verification) or situations that normally would trigger 
ratelimiting (multiple failed attempts in a short period of time) server-
relief could be made mandatory _on demand_.

That provides a very useful type of flexibility - under normal 
circumstances, even legacy clients which do BASIC auth with JS disabled will 
work; but when push comes to shove clients who are willing to share the load 
get priority.

&gt; If you need to enter passwords over a non-private channel, you
&gt; want to use *real* one-time-passwords (S/KEY or OPIE) you don't
&gt; want some "ersatz" which gives you security "most of the time",
&gt; but which fails fatally without any indication, if some bonehead
&gt; somewhere f**ks up the implementation.

Or use an augmented/verifier-based PAKE, which as I noted above is very 
similar in its problem domain.

&gt; So my conclusion was that client-assist is not worth it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but it wont be easy.

Eve's a pretty common name, I think she works in more places than just the
