Subject: Some KDF stumbling blocks, plus Common "memory-hard" approaches and
 amortized attack costs.

Greetings,

I'm writing the group as a developer of the Bitcoin reference
software, and editor of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP)
process, among other projects, where I am a consumer of KDF functions
on more or less on behalf of hundreds of thousands of users.
While opinions about Bitcoin (and it's ecosystem) are justifiably
mixed-- it's experimental technology after all-- it's hard to deny
that Bitcoin has upped the stakes for security, resulting in real
consequences for weaker constructions far more often that found
elsewhere.

Normally my first approach to password security in this space is to
advise against depending on them, or using them at all:   Users are
remarkably poor sources of entropy and if they do manage a secure
password human memory is fallible enough that they'll forget it,
resulting in loss or requiring a risky recovery mechanism. All that
said, reality intervenes and sometimes a password is the best tool
available.

There a couple of reoccurring issues that have arisen that inhibit the
use of good KDFs (or result in otherwise acceptable KDFs being
deployed with snake-oil grade parameters like ten iterations of
sha2-pbkdf2).

One is that developers will say they are using function-X but then do
so with parameters which make its properties completely meaningless.
While flexibility is important, I would recommend requiring minimum
parameters which actually would be expected to deliver benefits over
using plain sha2-pbkdf2 for a similar amount of time; so that bad
implementations have a little less ability to trade on a good
function's name. Likewise, the use of per-user salt is frequently
omitted, making pre-computation attacks highly effective and giving a
massive multi-target gain.

Another is that (again, for better or worse), many developers are
targeting inefficient execution environments:  Javascript in web
browsers, python running on rasberrypi, etc.  In one benchmark a
carefully optimized JS sha256 based iterated KDF was found to run
approximately 2000 times slower than a moderately optimized C
implementation on the same host.  With this kind of gap no KDF with
acceptable performance to the user is likely to present a meaningful
hurdle to attackers. It seems that regardless of the function's
specific construction far too much attacker-gap will be lost if a
native implementation is not available in these environments.  One of
the benefits of this competition may be justifying a native
implementation of a function, but there may be specific requirements
which could preclude it which should be sorted out in advance. I don't
work for a browser vendor (anymore) but e.g. I imagine that no one
would want a function that would allow arbitrary web-pages to allocate
two gigabytes of ram. If tweaks are required to actually get the
functions deployed, they should happen.

A third is that some applications must support small memory embedded
devices. For example, hardware wallets with 128kbytes ram. Cost, power
usage, durability against sidechannels, etc. all contribute to memory
limitations on these devices. Additional ram is not an option, the
option is to instead use a malware infested desktop PC or smartphone
or not use a KDF.

These devices are never themselves going to support KDFs with compute
or memory hardness beyond snake-oil levels.  I am saddened that none
of the proposals supported delegation scheme with
information-theoretic security ( which are possible,
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=311000.0" rel="nofollow">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=311000.0</a> ) but not surprised
since I was unable to come up for a construction for one which
achieved the memory hardness properties which are currently
fashionable for KDFs.   Even lacking that, any of these devices will
need a delegation scheme of some kind. If one isn't supported they
will either reject the strong KDF or achieve one informally via
pre-processing.  e.g. H1||H2 = HMAC(salt,password)   Key =
H(StrongKDF(H1,user)||H2) .   It would be be preferable if such
delegation were specified explicitly rather than applications rolling
their own incompatible and potentially less secure versions.

It's also the case that some protocols may need to fix parameters due
to a lack of a place to store and provide them.  Where that happens,
the parameters often get set at fairly minimal levels, these schemes
also get deployed without salting making matters worse. Delegation
allows for stronger parameters to be set, since users on the fringe
could be accommodated via delegation.

I am pleased to see that the recent finalist email had mentioned
side-channel attacks as a consideration. Some functions in this space
have very strong data dependent memory accesses, which could defeat
their security even compared to a basic non-iterated hash, e.g. when
coupled with zero knowledge authentication schemes.

One of the most difficult elements for me in considering the popular
memory hard functions is that the security argument given for their
advantage over functions like PBKDF2 is incomplete:  E.g. C.
Percival's venerable scrypt paper gives an attack model centered on
the _manufacturing_ costs of 130nm silicon (which is massively
outdated but a useful order of magnitude for relative comparison
purposes) and ignores operating costs completely.  We know from very
considerable experience (the Bitcoin network has provably performed on
the order of 2^82 executions of sha256) that compute intensive
hardware build on modern processes (e.g. 28nm) cost more in operating
energy than they do in manufacture after only on the order of 60 days
of use, these figures are robust and appear to apply to COTS hardware
like GPUs too.   An effect of memory hard functions constructed with
conventional hardware is that they shift costs from energy into gate
count.  This will have the effect of increasing the amortization
advantage for an attacker:

An attacker who is attacking SHA256 must continually burn energy as
much as he attacks, keeping his machine going for years at a time from
target to target does not reduce his costs per attack substantially.
An attacker attacking a memory hard function which packed all of its
costs into the upfront manufacturer would see substantial reductions
in their cost if they were able to continue applying their machine
again and again.  This is functionally similar to pre-computation
attacks on unsalted password hashes which have been devastatingly
effective: The attacker sinks a large upfront cost which is
independent of the number of users they will attack and then
additional users have a low marginal cost.

I have not yet had a chance to review all the finalists, but I
previously checked several of the candidates and could not find a more
holistic cost argument about costs which included operating costs. (If
one exists, please point me to it!)

Another area of concern is that C-RAM
(<a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~dunc/cram/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~dunc/cram/</a>) or through-silicon-vias may
yield considerable custom hardware gains for these memory intensive
functions, while basic compute grinding circuits are generally much
better studied and the optimization space is more clear. Many memory
hard functions also leave significant portions of the user's expensive
computer idle, leaving attacker-cost on the floor which could
otherwise be used. Others have mentioned botnets.

When considering the potential of state level attackers  (consider: A
_single_ F-18 fighter costs around $30 million dollars) concerns
around amortization and architectural gap reduction seem pretty
material. (Keep in mind that there are publicly known state operated
general purpose computers with over 1 petabyte dram).

A simple PBKDF2 has a strong argument for the minimum energy cost to
attack it, not just on a desktop but for the best possible attacker
barring any computer engineering or mathematical breakthrough.

I think it's likely the case that these concerns I've raised are real
but do not offset the advantages but without a persuasive analysis on
the lower bound costs that considers these effects if the user
tolerance allows enough iterations of a basic sha2-pbkdf2 to make the
cost high enough for the security objective of the application then it
would currently seem unwise to me to use another function where the
cost is less easily established and may be orders of magnitude lower
than expected (especially against attackers with hundreds of millions
of dollars of paid-off cracking hardware). E.g. a $1bn defence is
enough and can be achieved with 99.9% certainty with construction A,
another construction with an expected $10bn security level but a 5%
chance of &lt;$500 million security against an amortized attacker  would
not be a good choice.

An argument that a new KDF was better on conventional end-user
hardware even if the attacker's hardware were free would, if possible,
be a useful tool in establishing that KDF as a dominant choice.
