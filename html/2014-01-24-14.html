&gt;  Unless I've missed something important, surely that is only if the

&gt;
&gt; Actually, the salts are sufficient, you don't even need to know the hashes.
&gt;

​Fair enough, I was just trying to keep it generalised to avoid making
assumptions about other potential submissions.




&gt;
&gt; And "continuing access" is a bit of a stretch. You need some temporary
&gt; access for some measurements. It doesn't matter if you compromise the
&gt; hashes before you have access to the host, or at the time when you have
&gt; access to the host, or after you have access to the host.


Is it safe to presume the attacker must observe a correct login attempt for
each password he/she wishes to recover?  (assuming the salts are all not
equal to each other then in this scenario, the "correct" timing information
for each password will be different and can only be known by observing a
correct login)

​If that is indeed the case, the problem will be of differing severity
depending on the use-case.  In the situation of a standard website, the
attacker would ideally need continuing access as only a proportion of users
will login during a given time period.  In the situation of, say, a company
then it would be far more critical as you can expect the majority of staff
to login on any given day.



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  In that scenario, is it not likely that the attacker can also observe
&gt;&gt; plaintext
&gt;&gt; password attempts too?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, the whole point of a password hash is to provide a defense if the
&gt; salt (and, actually, the password hash) has been compromised. Who, on
&gt; earth, would need a slow and, maybe, memory-consuming password hash,
&gt; otherwise? What would be the point of the entire PHC?
&gt;

​The idea of an attacker stealing a password repository with hashes, salts,
etc, can be either a one-time affair - for example, SQL injection - or it
could be due to a persistent compromise of a system.  Both scenarios occur
frequently.

In the former example, the attacker will usually have difficulty in
performing timing observations for a correct login.  In the later, the
attacker will have timing information but in all likelihood will also be
able to capture the plaintext passwords anyway via their compromise of the
target system, obviating the need for using side-channels.

So, while I'm not entirely comfortable with exposing a side-channel that
could leak bits of the password, I suspect using timing information is not
the most efficient approach for an attacker (who as a group normally go for
the path of least resistance).




&gt;
&gt; Actually, it is amazing that with the memory access pattern, you don't
&gt; even need the password hash for this attack! In that sense, password hash
&gt; functions with password dependent memory access patterns can turn things
&gt; from bad to worse!
&gt;


Eh, yeah, secret-dependent memory access patterns is really asking for
trouble.  It might be more wise to generate a memory-hard - or at least
memory-tricky - access pattern from fixed values, e.g. salt/username/etc,
and use the non-commutative properties of logical operations against
arithmetic operations.




&gt;
&gt; (This is probably not a big deal. Usually, I'd expect salt and password
&gt; hash to be stored at the same place, so if either is compromised, the other
&gt; one is compromised as well. On the other hand, the salt is a "random"
&gt; value, and recent relevations regarding, e.g., the Dual-EC-RBG random
&gt; generator are frightening ...)
&gt;
&gt;
​I get the distinct impression it will matter more in some scenarios than
others.  Personally, I suspect that a one-size-fits-all general solution
will need to make some pretty poor compromises and will end up being a
mediocre improvement in most cases; the solution seems to require different
tactics depending on the context it is to be used in.  Although, I suppose
if this was easy it wouldn't be any fun.




&gt;
&gt; In any case, the adversary just needs the salt and the ability "to rent a
&gt; virtual machine sharing the same CPU as the defender" (quoting Marsh Ray).


​"Just" the salt ;-)   In other words, if the attacker has the salt, are
they likely to be needing to rent a co-incident VM?
