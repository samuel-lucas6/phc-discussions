&gt; Yes, now I can see how the shuffling may affect this.  Original scrypt's
&gt; sub-block shuffling appears to double the latency of your attack at each
&gt; level of the recomputation tree.  Correct?

Possibly. But there is always an option to store some extra subblocks
so that latency decreases further...

&gt;
&gt; I guess original scrypt's sub-block shuffling is defined in the exact
&gt; way it is in order to ensure that two successive applications of the
&gt; shuffling don't cancel each other.  However, I don't immediately see a
&gt; specific reason to have this requirement, and from the point of view of
&gt; maximizing latency in your attack, simple reverse order of sub-blocks
&gt; (e.g., "B_15 xor B_14", "B_14 xor B_13", etc. written to new B_0, B_1,
&gt; etc. instead of the current "B_15 xor B_0", "B_0 xor B_1", etc.) feels
&gt; like it'd work best.  I haven't thought this through yet.  I'd
&gt; appreciate your thoughts on the reverse order of sub-blocks idea.

An attacker would just store every $q$-th subblock thus spliting the
entire block into segments.
Then the recomputation can be contained to segments and parallelized,
like in our attack on Catena.

First I intended to write that playing with subblocks just complicates
the security. However, I have realized,
that it might be possible to devise a rigorous approach to that. To
figure out how the latency is affected by tradeoffs,
we consider a _stack_ of compression functions (BlockMixes, Argon2d
permutation, etc.) and mount a tradeoff attack on it.
The attacker's goal is to reduce the latency by careful storing of
subblocks (or their parts). We could give extra power to the attacker
by assuming he knows the recomputation tree structure in advance
(always true for data-independent addressing), so he might want to
store
different subblocks in different blocks.



&gt;
&gt;&gt; Our approach is to avoid this
&gt;&gt; situation for all, requiring that there simply must not be any
&gt;&gt; tradeoff attack on the compression function, or, in other words, the
&gt;&gt; computational latency must be tradeoff-resistant. The Argon2
&gt;&gt; parallelism that you have mentioned is somewhat unavoidable if we want
&gt;&gt; this resistance.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I figured this out yesterday.
&gt;
&gt; I think it's avoidable, but a possible reduction of parallelism just
&gt; does not occur with your approach naturally, and it'd cost a few extra
&gt; XORs or such to introduce it.  Looking at it from a different angle,
&gt; maybe this is your opportunity to easily introduce tunable
&gt; instruction-level parallelism (have a couple of flags dictate whether to
&gt; introduce or skip those extra data dependencies).

I think now it should be easy to add some chaining at 25% cost or so,
which increases the normal latency and avoids parallelism. Still,
this chaining will be subject to tradeoffs, so the tradeoff latency
will be pretty much the same as now.


&gt; I confirm your analysis.
&gt;
&gt; I assume the C(q) and D(q) figures are currently inexact, for the reason
&gt; you mention ("have to plug yescrypt mode of operation (and its
&gt; addressing) into our ranking method"), but they look sane to me, and the
&gt; combination with your attack on BlockMix_pwxform looks correct to me.
&gt;
&gt; I hope that yescrypt's D(q) will turn out to be slightly higher than
&gt; what you included here once you consider yescrypt's Wrap().  I guess
&gt; your current C(q) and D(q) assume modulo division in place of Wrap()?

No, I used the real Wrap(). Without wrap the numbers would be smaller.
But I did not exploit Wrap(), i.e. the storing algorithm does not know that
you never refer to first blocks.

I have posted the code that I used to generate the numbers online:
<a href="https://github.com/khovratovich/Tradeoff" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/khovratovich/Tradeoff</a>
The output .log file that is created contains the numbers. As
explained in our earlier paper,
the ranking method has parameter &lt;q&gt; (segment length). We run 100
tests on each q from 2 to 80,
and cluster tradeoffs that have the memory reduction around 1/D for
all integer D.

It lacks comments and is quite a mess, but at least people will see
where the numbers are coming from.

In order to get the numbers for other values of t, you just change the
constant 1.33 in main() to
the number of passes.

&gt;
&gt; You make two observations: about late inter-lane diffusion, and about
&gt; recovering missing blocks subblockwise.  It appears that you currently
&gt; only make use of the latter observation.  Do you think the former is of
&gt; any use in an attack?

It is just an extra parallelism. As long as it is fully employed by
the defender, I do not see an attack.

&gt; Thanks again,

You're welcome!
