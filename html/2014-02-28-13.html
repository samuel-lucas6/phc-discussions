I don't have a GPU background.  We were late to add GPU support to JtR
-jumbo, only starting with it in 2011, and it's not my primary focus.
Some other projects/tools started earlier and/or did more in this area.

&gt; and experience with
&gt; other multi-core devices, that you've got some totally awesome
&gt; massively parallel password authentication machine in mind, where the
&gt; multipliers and ALU logic add up to a lot even compared to the RAM.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be fun :-)

Yes, it would be.  We considered defensive use of FPGAs for password
hashing in a GSoC 2011 project.  We primarily focused on trying to make
the parallel crypto cores tiny, so that a lot would fit and thus CPU/GPU
attacks would be suboptimal because CPU and GPU cores and even
individual SIMD lanes are "too big" (leaving much of their resources
unused).  This wasn't very successful, although that could be in part
because of our lack of experience with optimization for FPGAs (I guess
many times better results could be achieved by instantiating resources
manually).  Resource usage was too high even for tiny cores
(Blowfish-like, but with ridiculously small S-boxes), so too few would
fit.  Simply going with DES, which is an excellent fit for Xilinx FPGAs,
would provide better CPU resistance.  CPUs run bitslice DES very fast,
but FPGAs are much faster yet.  (Of course, for defensive use the
parallel tiny cores' outputs would be combined into fewer hash outputs.)

Another hurdle was that modern CPUs' shuffle instructions available on
Cell, SSSE3, XOP essentially have 1-byte wide SIMD lanes with gather
loads (albeit from only 16 or 32 bytes of "memory" per instruction),
which matches our tiny S-boxes in FPGA too well.  A way to defeat this
would be via making the S-boxes variable (and we did, just like in
bcrypt).  We were afraid that AVX2 gather loads would defeat our defense,
although so far this wouldn't happen (Haswell's implementation is slow).
