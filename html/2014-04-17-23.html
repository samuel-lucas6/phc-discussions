&gt; Well, the "time" seems OK, although it is quite worse than what we got in our machine. The number "7" being multiplied by "Peak memory/second" eludes me, though. Each hashing operation in Lyra2 takes as input two memory locations ("prev" and "row*") and then its output is written to two memory locations ("row" and "row*). During Setup, "row" is just written over, while "row*" is XORed with the output (which may count as a "read"?); during the Wandering phase, both "row" and "row*" are XORed with the output. 

The reads from prev shouldn't be counted, because they're from cache.
XOR'ing of a memory location should be counted as two r/w operations
(one read and one write), if not expected to be readily in cache before
the read.  It appears that row* is already read to cache before it is
used a second time for XOR'ing, so there's no second read to count there.

Does this give you 7?

Setup:
- read from prev: doesn't count
- read from row*: counts
- write to row: counts
- read from row*: doesn't count (since we've already counted the same)
- write to row*: counts

Wandering:
- read from prev: doesn't count
- read from row*: counts
- read from row: counts
- write to row: counts
- read from row*: doesn't count (since we've already counted the same)
- write to row*: counts

This gives me 7, confirming Bill's analysis.

This is assuming T=1.  (I think higher T is unreasonable, unless you
specifically want to spend more time without increasing memory usage.)

&gt; Am I missing something? The r/w on the "state" variable, maybe? 

No, we're not counting anything that's in cache.

&gt; nCols is set to 64 by default, which means that each row has 64*768 bits = 6144 bytes = 6 KiB. In our machine we got better results with nCols = 128 (12 KiB), though. Those are the figures we put in the specification.

OK, so Bill's testing of yescrypt with r=32, which means 4 KiB blocks,
is fair comparison.
