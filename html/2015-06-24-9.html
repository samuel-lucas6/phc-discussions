&gt;  Some of the recent discussion has again turned to whether side-channel
&gt; resistance is worthwhile.  Marsh and I were discussing side-channel
&gt; protections a while back and there was one point that I found really
&gt; compelling.  I’ve tried to reproduce it here, apologies if this was already
&gt; discussed on the list.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Suppose you use password hashing function X in many products and services,
&gt; in a range of contexts (on mobile devices, PCs, servers, in VMs, etc…).
&gt; Now suppose that cache-timing attacks against X are shown to be practical,
&gt; someone has released an attack tool, and it’s in the news under the name
&gt; PasswordBleed, and someone has even made a logo for it.  The tool needs the
&gt; salt and username.  It works by observing the cache access pattern of a
&gt; victim process/VM, which narrows down the search space to a set of
&gt; passwords small enough to attack online (i.e.,
&gt; ​​
&gt; the tool re-computes the hashes for passwords in a dictionary and compares
&gt; their access patterns to the observed pattern, those that are close are
&gt; kept). So no breach has occurred and no hashes were leaked.  (I realize
&gt; that in most systems the salts aren’t public, but I think we all agree that
&gt; X should not get weaker if the salt is known).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; How do you respond/recover in this situation?  Which passwords were
&gt; compromised?
&gt;


In your stated scenario, the conditions are perhaps unnecessarily
contrived, e.g. if a PDF used a secret key in the calculation then it would
probably force the attacker to undertake an actual breach of the password
db.

However, if the situation is restated to assume that the salt and secret
key are private, your attack scenario may still hold.  Lets assume there is
i bits of global secret data, s, and j bits of per-password secret data, h,
say.  The question then becomes: how much of s and h you can determine in
observing the side-channel for a single PDF calculation; how many
calculations, n, per hash you can observe; and, obviously i and j.  That
would give you a rough idea of the resulting search space(s).
​
For practical purposes, I suspect you may need n much larger than
tolerable.  However, I've not kept pace with the research in the field and
there are other options available to the attacker such as testing random
online passwords repeatedly to gather statistical information to determine
s, and also compare to the much fewer samples of valid password timings for
h the attacker may have, i.e. you can't force a user to login 2^20 odd
times but you can probably do that many tests of random passwords which
might help exclude certain classes of password.

While I would imagine it's almost infeasible, at this moment in time I also
don't see why a PDF with data-dependent timings would ever be picked anyway.
