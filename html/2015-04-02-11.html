&gt;&gt; Hi Bill,

&gt;&gt;&gt; These charts look like Lyra2 is still running with 2 threads, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yescrypt is still running with 6 rounds rather than a more comparable
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 rounds.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The code for #if (nPARALLEL &gt; 1) for Lyra2 is not compiled in.
&gt;&gt; This is the patch
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; <a href="https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/commit/2e0d07b4a3f7d2dd69a1729c6770c0e39938fdc4" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/commit/2e0d07b4a3f7d2dd69a1729c6770c0e39938fdc4</a>
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Your patch looks good.  It compiles on my machine and runs with 1 thread.
&gt; I did have to move the -lcrypto to the end of the gcc command line to get
&gt; Pufferfish to compile.  Do you know what causes this?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Seriously, I do not want to tweak algorithms myself.
&gt;&gt; I can add another version but point me to git where is the modification
&gt;&gt; when author did these changes. But yescrypt was submitted in some form
&gt;&gt; and I think it should be tested this way.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I think running with default parameters is fine for one test, but this
&gt; shows the entry with the least computational hardness as being better than
&gt; the rest.  I think we also need to run benchmarks where we compensate for
&gt; weaker default parameters to compare them more even.

That comes without saying: it is useless to have a winner today just to
discover tomorrow that we missed some aspect.

That is why I believe normalizations are needed to compare the schemes
and isolated one parameter, computational hardness of PWXForm vs.
Blake2b vs. BlaMka being possibly one of them. As I understand it,
discussing (and experimenting with) the possible other aspects is
exactly the purpose of this list. :)

On that matter, we are finishing running some tests in which the number
of passes through memory and the (theoretical?) computational hardness
of both yescrypt and Lyra2 are similar, namely: yescrypt with T=2 and
everything else as usual vs. Lyra2 with T=1 and 1.5 rounds of BlaMka,
which amounts for 12 MUL + 12 ADD + 12 XORs like pwxform. From what my
students showed me, it seems to be a draw, but I prefer not to speculate
without the actual experiments to support this impression.


&gt; The  results still don't line up with mine, which is probably my fault
&gt; since I make a lot of mistakes.  I'll track it down.  However, this is a
&gt; case of one benchmarker doing work to validate another benchmarker.  This
&gt; is a bit nuts, so I'll post what I think should happen.  Basically, I think
&gt; we should require the authors to validate the numbers we post...
&gt; 

Confirmation from authors is indeed good (even though I may miss
something). I did not complain, though, because that sounded right to
me: at least the charts were similar to the results we reported in our
Reference Guide. Then I confirmed with Ewerton that setting "nPARALLEL =
1" would do the trick.

Sorry for allowing the confusion to flourish: I only found the e-mails
discussing there was a possible confusion now that you have (?) solved it :)
