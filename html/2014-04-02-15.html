Subject: Some remarks on Lanarea

Lanarea doesn't seem to use very much memory. Its memory requirement is
the size of its matrix, which is m_cost * 16 bytes, plus some small
constant. The reference implementation allocates an additional m_cost *
(16 + sizeof (uint8_t*)) bytes plus some heap-management overhead, but
this can be avoided through better optimization. m_cost * sizeof
(uint8_t*) and the heap overhead can be saved by allocating the matrix
as one contiguous block of memory rather than as an array of pointers to
individually-allocated rows. The 16*m_cost bytes allocated for 'chain'
can be saved by modifying blake2 to traverse its input in the order
determined by diagonal_ur(), and then passing the matrix to it directly.

Running Lanerea's reference implementation with m_cost = 100 and t_cost
= 1 takes roughly one second on my desktop. One second is a lot.  It's
far too much for authentication servers. It's reasonable for some key
derivation applications, but on the same order of magnitude as the
cutoff for reasonableness. Yet at this setting, its memory utilization
is only a little over 1600 bytes. In contrast, scrypt can use on the
order of a gigabyte when it's run for this long.

Part of the problem is that Lanarea's running time increases
quadratically with its memory cost. The loop beginning at line 7
iterates 16*m_cost times, and at the end of each iteration on line 33,
hashes 16*m_cost bytes of data. A corollary to this observation is that
as m_cost grows large, Lanarea's running time is asymptotically
dominated by the cost of hashing, which is the most GPU-friendly part of
the algorithm. The irregular order in which the hash traverses the
matrix won't hurt GPUs much, if at all, because the order is static and
therefore amenable to prefetching.

I don't think the conditional branching in lines 13 thru 26 is going to
be effective at defeating GPUs, as is claimed by the security analysis,
because the branches don't have to actually be implemented as
branches. Instead, just perform *all* of the operations (they only
require a couple of CPU cycles each), and then use CMOVs or bit
arithmetic to select the one you want. This might be a good idea even
for CPU implementations, because mispredicted branches are expensive for
CPUs too.

Once this branch-elimination technique is implemented, most of the inner
loop in lines 8 thru 27 can be implemented by 128-bit-wide SIMD
instructions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because CPUs have
those available too. The only line which looks like it would require
sixteen 8-bit instructions rather than one 128-bit SIMD instruction is
line 11, because the row index 'r' in the matrix lookup is dependent on
z.
