&gt; CALL FOR PAPERS AND TUTORIALS
&gt; 
&gt; PASSWORDS’14
&gt; The 7th International Conference on Passwords 
&gt; 8-10 Dec 2014, 
&gt; Trondheim, Norway
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Passwords conference was launched in 2010 as a response to the lack of robustness and 
&gt; usability of current personal authentication practices and solutions. Annual participation has 
&gt; doubled over the past three years.  
&gt; 
&gt; Venue NTNU campus, Trondheim, Norway. 
&gt; 
&gt; Conference Aim
&gt; The technical and practical problem addressed by the conference is illustrated by the fact that 
&gt; more than half a billion user passwords have been compromised over the last five years, 
&gt; including breaches at internet companies such as Adobe, Twitter, Forbes, LinkedIn, Yahoo, 
&gt; and LivingSocial. Yet passwords, PIN codes, and similar remain the most prevalent method 
&gt; of personal authentication. Clearly, we have a systemic problem.
&gt; 
&gt;  Passwords is the singular conference gathering researchers, password crackers, and 
&gt; enthusiastic experts from around the globe, aiming to better understand the challenges 
&gt; surrounding the methods personal authentication and passwords, and how to adequately solve 
&gt; these problems. The Passwords conference series seek to provide a friendly environment for 
&gt; participants with plenty opportunity to communicate with the speakers before, during, and 
&gt; after their presentations. (<a href="https://passwordscon.org/" rel="nofollow">https://passwordscon.org/</a>)

&gt; 
&gt; Instructions for paper submission
&gt; 
&gt; Accepted papers presented at the workshop will be included in the event proceedings and 
&gt; published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  All 
&gt; submission must be done at  <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=passwords14" rel="nofollow">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=passwords14</a>
&gt; 
&gt; Research Papers should describe novel, previously unpublished technical contributions 
&gt; within the scope of the call. The papers will be in-depth reviewed and selected using a 
&gt; double-blind review process by at least three members of the program committee. Paper 
&gt; length is limited to 16 pages (LNCS format) excluding references and well-marked 
&gt; appendices. The paper submitted for review must be anonymous, hence author names, 
&gt; affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references must be temporarily edited out for the 
&gt; review process.  The submitted paper (PDF or PostScript format) must follow the template 
&gt; described at (<a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>) by Springer.  
&gt; 
&gt; Short Papers will also be subject to peer review, where the emphasis will be put on work in 
&gt; progress, hackers achievements, industrial experiences, and incidents explained, aiming at 
&gt; novelty and promising directions. Short paper submissions should not be more than 6 pages in 
&gt; standard LNCS format in total. A short paper must be labeled by the subtitle "Short Paper." 
&gt; Accepted short paper submissions may be included in the conference proceedings. Short 
&gt; papers do not need to be anonymous.  The program committee may accept full research 
&gt; papers as short papers.
&gt; 
&gt; Tutorial proposals are expected to explain new methods, techniques, tools, systems, and 
&gt; services within the Passwords scope. The time frame is one hour.  Proposals can be submitted 
&gt; in any format. Publication will be by streaming, video and web.
