Subject: Re: [PHC] Should SkinnyCat have memCost and timeCost?

On Sat, Mar 29, 2014 at 12:22 PM, Solar Designer &gt; misunderstood, but
as described above it sounds like timeCost &gt; 0 would
&gt; reduce the whole scheme's usage of memory bandwidth accordingly, which I
&gt; find an undesired side-effect.  Set timeCost high enough and attackers
&gt; would even be able to use disks instead of RAM.  No?

Correct.  I've been playing with it a bit, and the sweet-spot for such
a parameter is when both internal cache and external DRAM bandwidth
become limiting factors.  So, you loose a bit of either external
memory written or have to run for a bit longer, but in theory, it may
gain some runtime hardness.  However, I'm not doing small random reads
in SinnyCat like I do by default in the second loop of TwoCats, so a
cache memory architecture designed for only large block reads might be
far more efficient than a CPU L1 cache.  For example, instead of a
16KiB cache like we see in our CPUs, have 16 1KiB caches, read from
them all in parallel, and then just use shift registers to stream
memory at some insane bandwidth.

&gt;&gt; I know this isn't terribly important.  I can probably change it in the
&gt;&gt; "tweaking" phase anyway.  What do you think?  Should a KISS PHS
&gt;&gt; include a time cost parameter?
&gt;
&gt; I have the same dilemma for a scripting-language friendly KISS scheme
&gt; that I _might_ submit.  Either choice makes sense to me, although I
&gt; think supporting t_cost (via continuing to run for longer after the
&gt; desired amount of memory has been filled) is preferable.  In case the
&gt; way you can support higher t_cost is only as you described above (and
&gt; assuming I understood you correctly), then maybe don't bother. ;-(  What
&gt; you described sounds more like a way to tune computation vs. bandwidth
&gt; usage than a way to tune the time cost.  I'd even say that the effect it
&gt; has on time is a side-effect, and it'd be unfortunate to have people use
&gt; this setting for the sole purpose of achieving the side-effect.
&gt;
&gt; I understand that you probably tried to keep the number of tunable
&gt; parameters to a minimum, in TwoCats as well.  This may be why you
&gt; arrived at only one parameter where there could have been two.
&gt;
&gt; Alexander

All true.  Thank for talking me out of the extra timeCost parameter.
Without the subblock reads, it probably wouldn't help much on AT cost
against an ASIC anyway, so I added the subblock loop, and then it
started looking so much like the full TwoCats, that I don't see the
point.

Splitting the time parameter in two as you suggest would allow TwoCats
to fill memory more rapidly, increasing the average AT cost compared
to just one parameter, though not the peak AT cost.  It's a tough
call, but I'll leave it alone.

I need to resubmit anyway because I failed to retest on your Haswell
box after making some minor changes, and naturally I introduced a bug.
 The AVX2 version segvs :-(  I also fixed a couple typos in the docs,
but nothing significant.  I'll leave SkinnyCat alone.

Thanks again for the advice.

Bill
