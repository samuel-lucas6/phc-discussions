The Argon team -

Congratulations on winning the competition!

Personally, I attribute this success largely to you managing to strike
the right balance that the diverse PHC panel members could agree on
Argon2 as the (basis for) the winner.  That's great.

&gt; 
&gt; The designers proposed an optional update:
&gt; * "smarter non-linear indexing (...) in order to flatten the memory usage
&gt; over time"

I support this tweak, although I haven't reviewed it yet - I have only
read the relevant announcement in here.  In fact, Bill and I were
advocating making a change in this area.

&gt; * BlaMka (from Lyra2) instead of BLAKE2b

&gt; 
&gt; Solar Designer proposed to integrate MAXFORM in Argon2d.

I still do propose this.  In fact, whether the final Argon2 gains a
MAXFORM chain or not will most likely determine whether I recommend it
for password hashing use in libc crypt(3) and such or not.  As Argon2 is
currently defined (whether 1.0 or 1.2), it is not good enough as a
universal replacement for bcrypt, IMO.  I think it's very important that
we correct that.

Then, if/once Argon2 gains a MAXFORM chain, the switch to BlaMka may
possibly be reverted, for simplicity.  I have no strong opinion on this.
The MAXFORM chain can provide far greater multiply latency hardening.

This needs more work to arrive at a specific proposal, ensuring minimal
differences between the i and d flavors (ideally, we'd have a similar
chain in i as well, just without the password-dependent S-box lookups),
and overwrites of the (initially highly sensitive) S-box contents (one
idea I have is to reuse the existing intermediate write of 1 KB to
state, which is currently wasteful on systems with write-through caches -
at least we'd put it to use, increasing the amount of state that a TMTO
attacker would need to deal with).

Dmitry, Alex - what do you think on this?  How do we cooperate on it best?

&gt; Bill Cox proposed (in his yesterday's email):
&gt; "- A hybrid Argon2i/Argon2d (Argon2id?), where some initial fraction of
&gt; memory hashing is done in a cache-timing independent manner, followed by
&gt; unpredictable addressing to improve off-line attack resistance.  If this
&gt; fraction were a parameter, it would unify Argon2i and Argon2d into one
&gt; algorithm.

I also support unifying the two, with a parameter.  As to making it
tri-state (or beyond) rather than binary, I have no strong feelings.

&gt; - Improved GPU resistance, similar to Yescrypt"

This fits under my MAXFORM chain proposal.

&gt; The selected tweaks should make Argon2d and/or Argon2i better but without
&gt; changing too much the original design (none of the above suggested changes
&gt; would).

Alexander
