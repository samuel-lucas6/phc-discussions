HI Alexander,

I doubt that you really need to store &lt;depth&gt; of indices. Of course,
this depends on an implementation of TMTO, but in a naive one that I
have in mind needs only one stored index per missing block. Suppose
that you store M[0],M[1], M[3],M[4], but M[2] and M[5] are missing
(picture attached). Then instead of M[5] you store the block address
needed to recompute M[5], i.e. \phi(5) = 2 (in this example). You look
up for M[2], it is missing too, so you go for M[0] and retrieve it.

So how many blocks that many indices (I ignore the possibility to
retrieve some of the indices from stored blocks).

Thus I do not understand why the block size is different before and
after TMTO in your calculations...

&gt;&gt; you're certainly right, the stored indices must be taken into account
&gt;&gt; when counting memory for tradeoffs. For the default parameters of
&gt;&gt; Catena and Lyra2 that we considered, these indices occupy less than
&gt;&gt; 1/1000 of total memory, and we just (explicitly or implicitly) ignored
&gt;&gt; this small addend in the computation.
&gt;
&gt; OK, this feels realistic, and I hope your estimate is correct.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The same happened to other
&gt;&gt; "service" information that we use in the attacks (such as storing the
&gt;&gt; access complexities, which accounted to 1/6000 of memory, cf. page 9
&gt;&gt; of the report).
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for mentioning this detail in the report.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Indeed, smaller blocks would increase the proportion of indices in the
&gt;&gt; memory. To have them occupy, say, 1/10 of memory, let us consider 1 GB
&gt;&gt; memory size. 100 MB of 3-byte indices would imply 2^{25} blocks, i.e.
&gt;
&gt; (Ignoring the 24 vs. 25 minor "rounding" discrepancy for the purpose of
&gt; this discussion.)
&gt;
&gt; This would imply we could refer to a total of 2^{25} blocks and other
&gt; data structures (we'd need such indirect references for depth &gt; 1
&gt; attacks), including possible duplicates (same indices), in whatever data
&gt; structure we'd use to mount the TMTO attack.
&gt;
&gt; That's not the total number of blocks there is.
&gt;
&gt; A question is then what TMTO ratio we could achieve while not needing
&gt; more than 2^{25} indices.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 32-byte blocks.
&gt;
&gt; I think not, for the reasons above.
&gt;
&gt; We wouldn't be storing each block's index exactly once.  I guess we'd
&gt; need to store roughly depth (e.g., 26.6 in the example I referred to
&gt; before) indices per (pre-TMTO or post-TMTO?) block (including many
&gt; duplicate index values, but this doesn't help us much if at all).
&gt;
&gt; Suppose we have an original memory size of 1 GB, a post-TMTO
&gt; without-indices size of 100 MB (the 1/10 ratio corresponding to depth
&gt; 26.6), and we spend another 100 MB on indices (bringing the actual TMTO
&gt; ratio to only 1/5, so a significantly worse attack than we had estimated
&gt; without considering the indices).  What block size would achieve this?
&gt; We can fit 100 MB / (26.6*3) = ~1.25 million sets of 26.6 indices in our
&gt; 100 MB allotted to them.  If the 26.6*3 = ~80 bytes are needed per
&gt; pre-TMTO block, then a block size of 1 GB / 1.25 million = ~800 bytes
&gt; achieves this.
&gt;
&gt; I made many guesses and assumptions here.  These might be about right or
&gt; they might be way off.  I think this needs to be researched for real.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; However, on the x86 architecture random access to
&gt;&gt; 32-byte blocks  would increase latency dramatically (my estimate would
&gt;&gt; be 3-5x at least), and make the scheme much slower and thus weaker.
&gt;
&gt; I agree there's a tradeoff here.
&gt;
&gt; My point is that for some of the larger TMTO ratios in your report, we
&gt; might not have to go to a block size as low as this in order to
&gt; significantly affect the effective TMTO ratio.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; On the architectures where the memory latency is only  a few CPU
&gt;&gt; cycles (AVR?), smaller blocks can be useful.
&gt;
&gt; Right.  This would apply in cases where TMTO attacks would otherwise be
&gt; relevant to most frequently accessed portions of data kept in a device's
&gt; local memory even in an overall large-memory scheme (using external
&gt; memory for most of its data), to fit more instances per device.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt;
&gt; Alexander
