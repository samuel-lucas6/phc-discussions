&gt; I reread it, and duh... It makes sense now.  The hash ix x^(2^(w+1)),

&gt; key x in case someone solves the knapsack problem

It is even simpler. The "+1" is meant to protect people who use 0 as
work factor: they would still have one squaring, which, while not good,
is still much better than plaintext passwords...

Also, that "+1" makes equations prettier for delegation, where you want
to do at least one squaring yourself so that the value which is sent to
the delegation server is already a quadratic residue. Without a "+1"
there, you would need a "-1" in some other places, and for purely
aesthetic reasons (that, by definition, I don't need to justify), I
prefer the "+1" to the "-1".


&gt; What happens in the future if Makwa is broken?

Same as for other cryptographic functions: that which is broken, is
broken. However, I have the _intuition_ that a break of Makwa would
probably also be a break of RSA, at which point we would enter
"interesting times" and the loss of some protection for Makwa would not
be the biggest of our problems.


&gt; A post hash provides shorter hash tags, but defeats work-increase.

The post hash is also meant to yield unbiased key material, when Makwa
is used as a KDF, e.g. for password-based encryption. Without the
post-hash, the first bytes of output are slightly biased, since the
result is modulo N which is not a power of 2.


&gt; I think I prefer the Catena-style work increase, and work factor w
&gt; values that are powers of 2 only.  This enables short hash tags which
&gt; I think will be more popular.

In my string-based encoding, I defined the work factor to be equal to 2
or 3 times a power of 2 (Makwa itself supports any nonnegative value for
the work factor w, but the string encoding format is constrainted to
these specific values). This indeed yields a shorter (and fixed-size)
encoding; however, the main reason was for better support of delegation.
The "delegation parameters" (the 300 value pairs) can be expensive to
generate, and are tied to a single work factor, so I wanted to limit the
number of possible work factor values in some way, so that
pre-generation of a number of sets of delegation parameters would be
possible.

Using only powers of 2 was not smooth enough to my taste, so I added
some intermediates. Possible work factors are then 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
16, 24, 32...
