Subject: Re: [PHC] Fwd: memory-hard password hashing

I don't get how "GPU hogs" verification works.

There are several fast double-precision CPRNG's designed for high speed GPU
operation that would be hard to beat with any ASIC.

Not sure how you managed to turn an CPRNG into a secure hash.

&gt; I wrote a GPU-focused memory-hard proof-of-work algorithm with fast
&gt; verification I call GPU Hog.  Basically, it hashes the input key material
&gt; to init a CPRNG that selects several 4 KiB blocks from a multi-GiB pool of
&gt; pseudo-random data.  It hashes the selected blocks together, and if the
&gt; result has enough leading zeros, then you've proven you have done enough
&gt; work.
&gt;
&gt; It requires a modern GPU with high GDRAM bandwidth since it is memory
&gt; bandwidth limited.  For mining, you need all of the pseudo-random data in
&gt; memory to mine efficiently, but for verification, you only need to generate
&gt; the several pseudo-random blocks and hash them together.  Verification is
&gt; faster than a typical public key operation, so it would not be the
&gt; bottleneck in verifying a block-chain.
&gt;
&gt; Is this similar to what you had in mind, or are you specifically looking
&gt; for GPU based password hashing?  I think that password hashing on mobile
&gt; phones and tablets could be considerably strengthened using their graphics
&gt; processors.

&gt;&gt; Personally I think "GPU friendly" is not a great thing for passwords,
&gt;&gt; since GPUs are asymmetrically more popular with attackers, but you might be
&gt;&gt; interested in checking out the "Vertcoin" project: <a href="https://vertcoin.org/" rel="nofollow">https://vertcoin.org/</a>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's a cryptocoin, similar to Bitcoin, with the gimmick that they have
&gt;&gt; always tried to target the GPU mining audience.  Their proof of work
&gt;&gt; started out with an adaptive N scrypt algorithm, but when KnC released
&gt;&gt; scrypt ASICs, they pivoted to a modified Lyra2, at which point a large
&gt;&gt; botnet took control of most of the mining power, and they pivoted again
&gt;&gt; with a Lyra2 more finely tuned for modern GPUs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think the ideal goal for password algorithms is CPU friendly, where the
&gt;&gt; most efficient machinery for calculating the hash is a commodity CPU.  At
&gt;&gt; that point, you could roll your own ASICs, but they wouldn't be much better
&gt;&gt; than what you could just pick up at Best Buy, and you'd lose out on the
&gt;&gt; economies of scale that CPU vendors have.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a focus on memory-hard algorithms in password hashing, since
&gt;&gt;&gt; that renders them ASIC/GPU resistant.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, it is /possible/ for an ASIC to be tightly coupled with DRAM in
&gt;&gt;&gt; ways that can exceed PC memory performance.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead, is there an algorithm that is "very GPU friendly"?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; GPU's are cheap, common and highly optimized for certain operations in
&gt;&gt;&gt; ways that make the construction of ASICs that beat them at what they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; best at very unlikely.   They are, essentially, "floating point matrix
&gt;&gt;&gt; operation ASICs".
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, this means that servers using such a mechanism may want to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; GPUs installed to reduce hashing times and allow a larger number of
&gt;&gt;&gt; operations to increase hashing security.   But I think this is a reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt; request for many applications.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If it takes 10 milliseconds to compute a single hash with highly
&gt;&gt;&gt; parallel FLOPs on a modern GPU, that affords a massive amount of security
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a hash - ASIC resistant in ways that memory-hard algorithms cannot be.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there an algorithm that already lends itself to this kind of
&gt;&gt;&gt; application?
