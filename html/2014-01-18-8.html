&gt; 
&gt; I think I'm inclined to disagree with this. But that's not to say you
&gt; are necessarily wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; First, I think it's a bit too broad of a statement.

I'd say it's too brief.  There's some context to it.  Some of that
context was in my message, some was implied.

&gt; It's hard to say
&gt; what a "webserver" is now, or what it will be in 10 years. For a
&gt; traditional webserver where you're just serving pages off disk, then
&gt; yes, there's technical justification for saturating the memory bus. But
&gt; large websites especially make heavy use of in-memory caching and
&gt; key-value stores like Redis, mod_mem_cache, memcached, etc, and a
&gt; function such as this could very likely have a negative impact on
&gt; performance.

I'm not saying that saturating the memory bandwidth will have no
performance impact.  It will usually have some performance impact.

Rather, I am saying that there's not that much of a difference between
using memory bandwidth and using CPU time.  Both take up resources away
from other processing.  Depending on what that other processing is, one
or the other may have greater impact on it.  Yes, using both a lot of
memory bandwidth and a lot of CPU time at once will generally have
somewhat greater impact than using only one of those.

No matter whether we use memory bandwidth or/and CPU time, we need to
tune the password hashing scheme's cost settings.  What I am saying is
that for a suitably designed password hashing scheme, suitable cost
settings for this use case should exist, even if that password hashing
scheme makes a lot of use of the memory bandwidth.

&gt; Now one my say that a large site would likely have the financial
&gt; resources to run dedicated caching servers, or dedicated authentication
&gt; servers, or whatever. And that's probably true. It's not hard to scale
&gt; up and scale out when you have money. But what I'm concerned about is
&gt; how well this will scale down. Which leads me to my second concern: a
&gt; webserver may not even be running on dedicated hardware. Webservers
&gt; running on a hypervisor with other memory-intensive virtual machines, or
&gt; even an oversubscribed hypervisor where virtual machines do not have
&gt; dedicated cores, could become problematic as well.

This means that a good password hashing scheme should be scalable down,
by tuning its cost settings accordingly.

&gt; So that's why I'm not so sure we can make a blanket statement like this.

I didn't mean it as a blanket statement, although I admit I worded it
that way, in part to oppose Peter's to a greater extent. ;-)

I meant it in context.  Recall that cost settings are to be tuned for a
certain maximum throughput, which in practice will only be seen in a
worst case scenario.  We're not talking about what happens all the time,
but rather about what happens when we're already fully using the CPU
cores for password hashing, because the number of concurrent
authentication requests has reached our worst-case maximum.  Why would
we want idle memory bandwidth in that extreme case?  Even in terms of
CPU time alone, other web server threads would run about twice slower
than they do on an idle server, if they're as numerous as the password
hashing threads.  This is how time-sharing works.  The same thing
applies to memory bandwidth in that scenario - twice less of it is
available to those other threads, if they use it as much as our password
hashing scheme does (although chances are that they don't).  The fact
that there are generally fewer memory channels than CPU cores doesn't
affect anything when, as in this example, there's equal demand for
memory bandwidth from an equal number of threads.  And if the demand is
not equal, then the memory bandwidth is split non-equally accordingly,
which is great.

Yes, 2x slowdown is bad, but it needs to be thought of in context.  If
we can't afford 2x slowdown at a throughput of e.g. 1000 req/s, let's
e.g. halve our cost setting(s), so that this condition would occur only
at 2000 req/s, even if our target throughput for the web server is only
1000 req/s.  With such settings, on one hand we won't ever fully use the
server's resources for password hashing under planned-for throughput (no
more than 1000 req/s), but on the other we have a bonus of supporting
higher throughput just in case, albeit with higher than planned for
proportion of resources used for password hashing when that unplanned
scenario does occur.

This sort of tradeoff and tuning has nothing to do with us using memory
bandwidth rather than only CPU time.  It applies when we're only using
CPU time as well.

&gt; Additionally, I think the "convincing folks" part of Peter's statement
&gt; is the key.  Even if we do have sufficient technical justification for
&gt; saturating the memory bus, convincing users that it's totally cool to do
&gt; so is another story. Gaining widespread adoption will already be our
&gt; biggest challenge regardless of the function we select as the winner,
&gt; and a function that saturates memory bandwidth may be an even harder sell.

Yes, adoption is difficult.

Let's look at this from a different angle: why would a password hashing
scheme want to saturate the memory bandwidth (under maximum supported
throughput with the tuned settings)?  A reason is if it can't make
something else (or a comfortably high number of other things) be a
component in the lower bound for attacker's cost.  This is the case for
EARWORM.  It is also the case for escrypt at high-throughput settings
(thousands of requests per second, thus can't fill much memory in scrypt
fashion, so it's important to also have a large "ROM").

These examples don't apply e.g. to default installs of typical web apps.
They're slightly more likely to appear as non-default / advanced
settings or extra modules, although even that would be a hard sell.
Another use case would be dedicated authentication servers for large
user databases and/or with high-value accounts.

Without a "ROM", do we want to saturate the memory bandwidth?  Do we
want to get close to saturating the memory bandwidth?  I think that yes,
in a sequential memory-hard KDF/PHS, we want to stay close to saturating
the memory bandwidth.  This is for two reasons: filling more memory in
limited running time (when somewhat high throughput is needed, or/and
when we have a lot of memory for such use), and requiring that the
attacker provide memory that is about as fast in order to achieve a
similar speed.

Yes, bcrypt avoids this nicely yet defeats GPUs (so far) - but it
doesn't defeat ASICs.  I think a good PHC candidate intended (possibly
among other use cases) for general password hashing use with native code
implementations (not scripting) on commodity servers should possess best
properties both of bcrypt and of sequential memory-hard KDFs with
non-trivial memory sizes (unlike bcrypt's).  So far none of the proposed
PHC submissions qualify (they don't bother about GPU resistance at low
memory sizes, so are likely weaker than bcrypt on current server
hardware at throughput levels required for mass user authentication).
