Subject: Re: [PHC] yescrypt &amp; Lyra2 on GPU

Thinking out loud and making minor corrections on a few sub-topics I
brought up yesterday:

On Sat, Apr 28, 2018 at 11:23:32PM +0200, Solar Designer wrote:
&gt; For yescrypt, the split is across 16 SIMT threads, but due to yescrypt's
&gt; use of 64-bit math each pair of those threads ends up doing duplicate
&gt; work by two threads within the pair, so it's actually a split into 8
&gt; rather than into 16 parallel computations.  I guess such duplicate work
&gt; isn't any worse than leaving those threads unused would have been (if
&gt; we're bumping into NVIDIA's shared memory size) whereas the extra data
&gt; exchanges that would be needed otherwise would have cost extra.

I seem to have imagined those "extra data exchanges that would be needed
otherwise".  I now think that none of those would be needed with a split
into 8 rather than 16 threads.

&gt; #define Shared(a) *(uint2*)&amp;shared_mem[(threadIdx.y * 512 + (a)) * 4 + (threadIdx.x &amp; 2)]

This results in the same duplicate 64-bit lookups by adjacent threads
(thread index bit 0 is ignored here).

&gt;                 uint2 buf;
&gt;                 uint32_t x[256];

With a split into 8 threads, the x array (holding the current thread's
lane in the current block being worked on) would have to be of uint2's,
so twice larger in each thread.

&gt;                         for (k = 0; k &lt; r * 2; k++) {
&gt;                                 x[k] ^= x[(k + r * 2 - 1) &amp; (r * 2 - 1)];

Also, we only do one 32-bit XOR here.  With a split into 8 threads, it'd
be a 64-bit XOR here, which means pair(s) of 32-bit instructions.

&gt;                                 buf.x = __shfl_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, x[k], 0, 2);
&gt;                                 buf.y = __shfl_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, x[k], 1, 2);
&gt; #pragma unroll
&gt;                                 for (j = 0; j &lt; 6; j++) {
&gt;                                         x0 = ((__shfl_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, buf.x, 0, 4) &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 255) + 0;
&gt;                                         x1 = ((__shfl_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, buf.y, 0, 4) &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 255) + 256;
&gt;                                         buf = mad64(buf.x, buf.y, Shared(x0));
&gt;                                         buf ^= Shared(x1);
&gt;                                 }
&gt;                                 if (threadIdx.x &amp; 1) x[k] = buf.y;
&gt;                                 else x[k] = buf.x;
&gt;                         }

The 32- vs. 64-bit XOR mentioned above would be counter-balanced by
simplification at the end of the loop, where it'd be an unconditional
64-bit write into x[k] instead of the if/else (which on SIMT means that
all threads pass through both 32-bit writes anyway, just with one of
those masked out).  Overall, it's a minor difference not obviously in
favor of either approach, and it's outside of the pwxform rounds loop.

So this leaves splitting the size of x as the likely primary reason for
going for the duplicate work.

OTOH, the code has the size of x hard-coded with generous 256 elements,
which allows for up to r=128, which I think is more than any cryptocoin
currently uses.  So maybe the size of x is not limiting anything yet,
and the split into 16 rather than 8 is there for no reason or for some
yet unmentioned potential reason.

Another reason could be what happens in other code beyond the most
performance critical excerpts I posted.  Maybe the split is beneficial
for some less performance critical code.  Just to give it the benefit of
the doubt.  But overall, I expect little difference in performance
achieved with 16 vs. 8 threads per yescrypt instance.

&gt; yescrypt 0.5'ish (PHC v0 from 2014) at N=4096 r=16 p=1 t=0 (8 MiB)

&gt; GTX 1080 Ti - 3600-4200 h/s

&gt; But we're interested in the performance figures here for how they'd
&gt; relate to uses of yescrypt for password hashing, where there wouldn't
&gt; necessarily be a "more profitable" hash to crack.  Well, yescrypt 1.0 by
&gt; default uses 12 KiB for S-boxes vs. 0.5's 8 KiB.  So maybe the number of
&gt; concurrent warps would have to be lowered accordingly, which will slow
&gt; things down by up to as much (that is, up to by a third).  There are
&gt; also the added writes into S-boxes, which are essentially free on CPU
&gt; (the L1 cache write ports and the execution port for store instructions
&gt; would have been idle otherwise), but will probably cost a little bit of
&gt; time within each thread on GPU.

&gt; Overall, it looks like with current yescrypt a dual-CPU server doing
&gt; password hashing at low to moderate memory cost (a few megabytes per
&gt; hash) will be roughly on par with one of the largest GPUs, when not
&gt; using a ROM.

To clarify: I assume that those dual CPUs in a server would also have
higher core count (each) than typical desktop CPUs I mentioned in the
mining context.  For example, yescrypt-1.0.1/PERFORMANCE shows a dual
Xeon Gold 5120 server (28 physical cores) achieve 2400 h/s at 16 MiB.
At half that memory, it'd achieve around 5000 h/s, and that's with
yescrypt 1.0+.  From the cryptocoin mining speeds, we see that a GTX
1080 Ti achieves less than that with yescrypt 0.5, and we expect a
further 1.5x or so slowdown on GPU for 1.0 compared to 0.5.  This gives
5000 for CPU vs. estimated (3600+4200)/2/1.5 = 2600 for GPU.  The
largest NVIDIA Volta GPU would probably be at around 5000 again.

&gt; For yescrypt with a ROM, there are no GPU implementations (that I'm
&gt; aware of) yet.  I suppose they could eventually use CUDA uniform memory

It's called "unified", not "uniform".

&gt; to access host's or/and other GPUs' memory (as the ROM is meant to be
&gt; much larger than a single GPU card's memory).  This will increase
&gt; latency, and to compensate for that even more concurrent instances would
&gt; need to be run on each GPU, again bumping into the GPU's memory sizes
&gt; (on-die and/or on-card, whichever is hit first), so the speed will be
&gt; impacted.
&gt; 
&gt; So I think for yescrypt with a ROM this isn't too severe a threat yet,
&gt; but bumping up the S-boxes size could make sense anyway.

Actually, latency will probably only matter once per block, so will
significantly affect overall speed at low r and not so much at higher r.

The unified memory bandwidth will definitely limit overall performance,
so it could become a matter of how much bandwidth to yescrypt's ROM
we're using defensively.  And frankly it's not that much: we split the
host's memory bandwidth between yescrypt RAM writes, RAM reads, and
finally ROM reads.  In a GPU attack, the yescrypt RAM accesses will
presumably stay in that GPU card's global memory, so only the ROM
accesses will compete e.g. for the host memory and PCIe bandwidth.
Nevertheless, this will be limiting possible attack speed.

&gt; The above code for yescrypt does not try to split the two S-box lookups
&gt; across threads, though.  (It only splits the four portions of each of
&gt; the two 128-bit lookups.)

No, the code doesn't split "the four portions of each of the two 128-bit
lookups".  It splits each 128-bit lookup into two 64-bit lookups done
twice (duplicate work).
