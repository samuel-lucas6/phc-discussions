&gt; In all academic paper submissions in conferences, researchers submit their

Reviewing papers is part of an academic's job. And most
conferences/journals do at least single-blind reviews (that is,
reviewers are almost always anonymous). There's been some rigorous
studies showing that it's better than non-blind reviews, btw.

&gt;&gt; Succinct response (not much time to elaborate):
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * You will find "secretive selection" and non-public discussions of
&gt;&gt; the committee panel in all crypto competitions: AES, NESSIE, eSTREAM,
&gt;&gt; SHA-3, CAESAR, and PHC.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * A non-negligible difference of PHC compared to other projects: we're
&gt;&gt; all unpaid volunteers, working on this project on our free time, where
&gt;&gt; NIST had a dedicated team for AES and SHA-3, a budget to organize
&gt;&gt; workshops, etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * We wished we had time and resources to prepare a lengthy and
&gt;&gt; detailed report, but that wasn't the case. We felt that it was better
&gt;&gt; to publish such a summary than nothing at all.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear all,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think the discussion is not leading to a meaningful and factual
&gt;&gt; &gt; direction.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Let me humbly try to steer the discussion towards concrete measures and
&gt;&gt; &gt; stop
&gt;&gt; &gt; this blame game. There are some TO-DO items in the comments, which can
&gt;&gt; &gt; help
&gt;&gt; &gt; restore the credibility of the competition (at least among some of us
&gt;&gt; &gt; who
&gt;&gt; &gt; are not happy about it).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. The panel should make the voting and discussion on the selection
&gt;&gt; &gt; criteria
&gt;&gt; &gt; public.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I refer to the AES competition archived selection criteria here:
&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm" rel="nofollow">http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm</a> Note the
&gt;&gt; &gt; language
&gt;&gt; &gt; from section 4: "In order to provide a basis for the analysis and
&gt;&gt; &gt; evaluation
&gt;&gt; &gt; of encryption algorithms submitted to be considered for incorporation
&gt;&gt; &gt; into
&gt;&gt; &gt; the FIPS for AES, evaluation criteria will be used to review candidate
&gt;&gt; &gt; algorithms.  All of NIST’s analysis results will be made publicly
&gt;&gt; &gt; available."
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; It is in the spirit of an open competition to keep the process
&gt;&gt; &gt; transparent.
&gt;&gt; &gt; All discussion leading to the selection should have been public already.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. I had pointed this earlier that the comment on our design Rig is as
&gt;&gt; &gt; follows: "Similar to Catena, but received less attention (cf. bugs found
&gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the specification and code)".
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; There are two parts to this comment. (a) Similar to Catena. (b) bugs
&gt;&gt; &gt; found.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I would have liked the panel to clarify each of the two points with
&gt;&gt; &gt; respect
&gt;&gt; &gt; to the revised submission Rig v2 which is the one the PHC website lists
&gt;&gt; &gt; since October 2014. Clearly, (b) is false for this. Further, is (a)
&gt;&gt; &gt; measurable by any means ?  Aren't there novel ideas in the design of
&gt;&gt; &gt; Rig,
&gt;&gt; &gt; apart from ideas from Catena ? Given the publicly available eprint
&gt;&gt; &gt; report
&gt;&gt; &gt; which I referred to in my previous mail, is it fair to dismiss the
&gt;&gt; &gt; design in
&gt;&gt; &gt; this single sentence ? If Rig v2 was not being considered, shouldn't the
&gt;&gt; &gt; designers have been informed at the time of the revised submission
&gt;&gt; &gt; itself
&gt;&gt; &gt; that this version will not be evaluated any more ? (Related: weren't
&gt;&gt; &gt; other
&gt;&gt; &gt; design also allowed to be modified around the same time ? The changes
&gt;&gt; &gt; were
&gt;&gt; &gt; not overhauling the design, these were minor modification to handle the
&gt;&gt; &gt; issues which Bill Cox found. I don't think there was any comment on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; design after that. If the panel was not looking at the revised
&gt;&gt; &gt; submission
&gt;&gt; &gt; then we could have as well saved our time to do other things, rather
&gt;&gt; &gt; than
&gt;&gt; &gt; investing our time in something which no one was interested in looking
&gt;&gt; &gt; at.)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. It is not just our design. Most designs have one line comments on
&gt;&gt; &gt; them in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the document shared earlier. To say that the panel could not prepare a
&gt;&gt; &gt; detailed document is mocking the competition. As pointed by Krisztian
&gt;&gt; &gt; earlier, many of these one liners are actually not factual but based on
&gt;&gt; &gt; opinions. The report should have had meaningful comparison of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; candidates, not just one liners on the entries. Dismissing entries by
&gt;&gt; &gt; such
&gt;&gt; &gt; one liners is devaluing the effort put by so many designers in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; competition.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If you want some specific metrics, then here is a randomly thought list
&gt;&gt; &gt; which is not exhaustive: performance on various platforms, cryptographic
&gt;&gt; &gt; strength, memory hardness, .... (add whatever else you like, make a
&gt;&gt; &gt; baseline
&gt;&gt; &gt; and compare all entries on some rational basis).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; In my humble opinion, the bitterness which we are witnessing in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; mailing
&gt;&gt; &gt; list is due to the secretive selection and the improper rationale for
&gt;&gt; &gt; selection in the document. If these were public and based on detailed
&gt;&gt; &gt; discussions, I don't think anyone would have complained. IMHO, the panel
&gt;&gt; &gt; members should have already realized that there is a lot to blame
&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves
&gt;&gt; &gt; rather than the people questioning their decision now. To blame the
&gt;&gt; &gt; questions on the "frustration of non-finalists" is not showing the
&gt;&gt; &gt; maturity
&gt;&gt; &gt; expected from a panel, which contains many good people whom many of us
&gt;&gt; &gt; trusted (if that was not the case then you wouldn't have received so
&gt;&gt; &gt; many
&gt;&gt; &gt; submissions in the first place). Honestly, please discuss with some
&gt;&gt; &gt; researchers in universities around you about the way the selection has
&gt;&gt; &gt; happened so far, showing them the "selection rationale document" and
&gt;&gt; &gt; "the
&gt;&gt; &gt; process followed" (the secret voting, and not even following that voting
&gt;&gt; &gt; perfectly;  claiming that this was in addition to the private discussion
&gt;&gt; &gt; etc). I am quite certain that none of them will favor the process as
&gt;&gt; &gt; followed. All of it was easily avoided by keeping the process in public
&gt;&gt; &gt; domain and having a well thought out selection document.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; To quote Bruce Schneier on the AES competition (a losing finalist for
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; competition): "I have nothing but good things to say about NIST and the
&gt;&gt; &gt; AES
&gt;&gt; &gt; process".
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; We were expecting a competition in the spirit of AES, but unfortunately
&gt;&gt; &gt; things haven't gone that way.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; 4. I deviate slightly to the "flexibility" and "simplicity" ideas of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; AES
&gt;&gt; &gt; competition. The AES competition had a criteria termed "simplicity", but
&gt;&gt; &gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt; already created lots of discussion/confusion that time. To quote a few
&gt;&gt; &gt; lines
&gt;&gt; &gt; from the TwoFish team (<a href="https://www.schneier.com/paper-twofish-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.schneier.com/paper-twofish-final.pdf</a>)
&gt;&gt; &gt; "
&gt;&gt; &gt; "Simplicity” is the NIST criterion that’s hardest to describe. Lines of
&gt;&gt; &gt; pseudocode, number of mathematical equations, density of lines in a
&gt;&gt; &gt; block
&gt;&gt; &gt; diagram: these are all potential measures of simplicity. Our worry about
&gt;&gt; &gt; simplicity as a measure is that the simplest algorithms are often the
&gt;&gt; &gt; easiest to break. ...".
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  If things are hazy then people will question them.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards.
