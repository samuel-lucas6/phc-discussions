&gt; So, after my threads finish filling memory with their hashed data, I could

IF I understand correctly what you mean (a big IF, indeed), you consider 
the following steps:

   1. fill the memory with some password dependent stuff in some password
      independent order

   2. read (and, maybe, modify) the memory at password-dependent places.

Am I right?

This is actually what ROMIX does. And one issue here are cache timing 
attacks, under the ASSUMPTION that you can measure cache timings at the 
system (a big ASSUMPTION, indeed). Consider the adversary did figure out 
which memory pages you read from. Now a memory-constrained attack would 
just execute the first step with a password-candidate, without storing any 
values to memory, except for those accessed in the second step. If, in the 
second phase, it would need to access one memory location not stored 
before, it could safely reject the password-candidate.

Or do you mean to run that second phase after, say, a full Catena (or 
anything similar)? That would make some sense. However, for Catena-i, with 
large enough i, I don't see much need for that. Even i=2 would already 
cause pain for the attacker.

&gt; Because it only comes at the end, an attacker looking for a specific cache
&gt; miss pattern would not gain a significant advantage in password guessing
&gt; speed, so the major complaint against password based memory accesses goes
&gt; away.  However, some information still leaks.  In particular, while the
&gt; cache timing is useless for password guessing, it does provide a
&gt; detectable timing signature that proves a particular user has just
&gt; authenticated his password.  This seems a bit silly to worry about.  For
&gt; example, I can just run the "who" command to see who's logged in, or ps to
&gt; see what processes they are running.

But it would also allow the attacker to determine when a specific user has 
changed her password. Especially when you can call "who" to figure out who 
has logged in. This is somewhat worrisome. At the very least, you 
determine if the password, that you currently are trying to crack, has 
already been changed or not.

The "smoke" approach should defend against that, but on the whole this 
looks more complicated than stacking two or more bit-reversal graphs, ;-)


So long

Stefan
