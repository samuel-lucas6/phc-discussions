&gt; I've just posted an idea on how you can have both.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think we're down to the last 30% in how much we make an
&gt;&gt; attacker pay for hardware.  That's a good place to be.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but that's ignoring attackers with pre-existing hardware such as
&gt; GPUs combined with low-memory settings needed for mass password hashing.
&gt; For those, we need something very similar to bcrypt's access pattern
&gt; (yes, it is leaky), which all upcoming PHC submissions discussed so far
&gt; lack.  I am experimenting with introducing it for escrypt.  Until that
&gt; is done, I am not happy about PHC submissions for general-purpose uses.
&gt; Specialized uses like as KDF in TrueCrypt may be OK.
&gt;
&gt; When scaled down to low memory settings like e.g. Litecoin's 128 KB, the
&gt; PHC submissions so far may be about as much faster to attack on GPU than
&gt; to compute on CPU, as Litecoin is to mine on GPU vs. CPU (10x to 20x).
&gt; While we could stipulate a minimum memory size per hash of e.g. 16 MB,
&gt; this would exclude some use cases.  We can do better than that.  We
&gt; don't have to be worse than the 17-year-old bcrypt at comparable settings
&gt; (currently we are much worse).
&gt;
&gt; Alexander

I was under the impression that bcrypt was difficult for a GPU due to
it's memory size requirement, and that soon with increased L1 cache
sizes, bcrypt may be fast to hash on GPUS.  Some paper I read said so,
and papers are never wrong :-)

What is it about bcrypt's memory access pattern that is hard for GPUs?

What I currently do for GPUs is to allow for memory sizes as low as
1MB, with block sizes as low as 4 bytes, and if that hashes to
quickly, there is a repetition factor that increases the inner loop
calculations to run as long as you like.  I guess my 1MB may be too
coarse, but below 1MB just seems like giving up on memory hardness.
Maybe if I moved the repeat loop outside the outer loop, the memory
access pattern would be more random, but the inner loop enables small
block sizes without having cache miss penalties dominate.  Is
something like this what is required?
