&gt; 
&gt; This would help single-thread performance a lot, which is important
&gt; for low-end CPUs.

Low-end CPUs are a different story, needing separate benchmarks and
possibly tuning of more parameters.  It's sub-optimal to make
conclusions about what's needed for them from benchmarks on Haswell.

BTW, I ran some yescrypt benchmarks on Celeron N2815 (a recent low-end,
low power Intel CPU for laptops) where SIMD multiplies are no faster
than scalar ones per-element (so are much slower per instruction).
To support CPUs like this better, we need a mode where the SIMD level
parallelism would be removed.  This does mean exporting some (at least
one) pwxform compile-time tunables as runtime parameters, but not
necessarily the pwxform rounds count (although I'll likely make it
tunable via flags too).

&gt; I did more 2MiB benchmarks.  I needed to tweak it to initialize the
&gt; first block faster, but after that, I got:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 thread, 2MiB: 4,216 h/s
&gt; 3 thread, 2MiB: 11,013 h/s
&gt; 1 thread, 1MiB: 8,695 h/s
&gt; 3 thread, 1MiB: 17,452 h/s

Your "3 thread, 2MiB: 11,013 h/s" is impressive.

A concern, though: if performance drops significantly with more threads
(I guess it does for more than 3 threads in these tests?), this poses a
problem for uses for user authentication, where the number of concurrent
instances may be high during load spikes.  We don't want a short request
rate spike to result in a performance drop, from which the server might
not be able to recover easily until the request rate drops below a lower
threshold.  This is why for such use I may prefer the case where
yescrypt delivered 3400 c/s for 8 threads and 3150 for 4 threads, over
the case where it delivered 4400 c/s for 8 threads and 6500 for 4 threads.
While for cryptocoin mining the 6500 figure would be relevant since the
thread count is easily controlled, for authentication the 4400 figure
may be more relevant as it affects server capacity under worst case
scenario.  (Not letting more than N concurrent threads proceed to hash a
password is possible in some setups, but not in all - e.g., not when the
threads may be from different services running in different VMs sharing
a machine.)

&gt; I prefer staying at 2MiB for PoW for a crypto-currency.  This is small
&gt; enough to fit into most Intel compatible on-chip caches, while making
&gt; it bigger would begin to blow out of them.  If you cut cache down by a
&gt; factor of X, that makes an ASIC attack X times more effective,
&gt; especially since it seems they are running the PoW algorithm
&gt; single-threaded and applying threading in an outer loop.  Over time,
&gt; it would be good to increase the memory size to keep up with cache
&gt; size growth, or eventually an ASIC will have too much of an advantage.

I think an ASIC to mine BTSY wouldn't necessarily have the 2 MiB blocks
on die.  It could instead be similar to a specialized GPU or Xeon Phi,
with latency-optimized circuits for yescrypt's anti-GPU rapid random
lookups.  Perhaps it'd mine BTSY a few times faster than a GPU would
(and perhaps a GPU would mine it with CPU-like performance).

&gt; It will be interesting to see Arm benchmarks using their SIMD units.

Sure.  We need to add NEON intrinsics to yescrypt-simd.c, and benchmark.
