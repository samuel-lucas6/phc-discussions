Subject: [PHC] updated report of POMELO

Dear all,

The POMELO report is updated.  The updated version is available at:

    https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/POMELO-v3.pdf

There are several changes to the report:

1)  Provided cryptanalysis in Section 2.1 to show that POMELO is strong
against differential and linear attacks.

2)  Provided more analysis of the low-memory attack in Section 2.2.
    In the previous report, I analyzed that if the memory in the attack is
half of the state, the number of operations is increased at least 128 times
for t_cost = 0.
    Now I added that if the memory in the attack is one quarter of the
state, the number of operations is increased at least 65536 times for
t_cost = 0.
    (It is just to show that POMELO is very strong against TMTO attack.)

3) Introduced POMELO-KDF to generate a key with arbitrary length in Section
1.5.
    Simply speaking, POMELO is iterated in POMELO-KDF to generate a key
with arbitrary length (in case if a very long key is needed).

4)  In the previous report, I forgot to initialize the variable
"random_number" in the POMELO v2  specification.  Now I added that
initialization in the Step 4 of Section 1.2  (so that the specification
match the code).
    There is no change to the codes.
