The primary goal of password hashing is to defend against offline
attacks in the event that a password database has been compromised.

you don't get to choose the attack model. attackers choose the attack
model. to be precise, you choose the attack model, but if you want
yourself to be taken seriously, you need to consider all viable attack
routes. simply declaring an attack "not primary" will not help you
defend data.
