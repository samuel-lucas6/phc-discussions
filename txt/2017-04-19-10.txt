My personal favorite, because I like the lorenz attractor, and it's been
shown to be secure.   Not sure how optimal it is for GPU, but it's all
floating-point arithmetic.   Possible to do it faster with an ASIC?  Maybe.

Fast PRNG, not sure how secure it is:

This library analyzes and optimizes a number of well-known PRNG's for GPUs,
haven't read it too closely.

Fourier transforms, should be fairly secure, needs more analysis:
