Also, if instead of a simple linear chain in the first row, if we put
a Catena-3 graph, the recomputation penalties are much higher.  I get
over 140X for this modified Catena-2 graph when trying to pebble it
with half the memory.

With a Catena-8 graph in the first row, my poor pebbling algorithm
throws in the towel and goes home.  I can only get small graphs to
pebble in a reasonable time, and the penalty is many thousands times
more computation for 50% of the memory.

Is this enhanced Catena-2 as good or better defending against TMTO
attacks as Catena-3?
