I assume memory-hard problems are in play. Example: SHA-256 hashing and
filling the whole 4GB memory space with PRN to derive the next address
in memory, add a 128-bit salt, repeat hash again, and so on. Thus
overcoming low-memory requirements of PBKDF2 and forcing the use of the
whole memory. Pipelined FPGA, parallel CPUs or GPUs can't then be used. 
Clustering will not work. A Critical-Path is formed due to mixing with
the password key (hashed 44-64 character Yubikey) at each hashing. 
Whole memory space must always be filled to get the next hash correct.
Memory jumps will seem random. Scrypt comes to mind.
