I was about to implement Catena with 1/2 the memory and faster vs the

Cool. I'm eager to see the performance benchmarks of your
implementation. Please contact me after you finished the implementation.


When I noticed a bug in the reference code https://github.com/cforler/catena/pull/3 
Basically you are doing the work of LAMBDA but getting the security of
LAMBDA-1. So Catena-3 is like Catena-2.

Oops! Thanks a lot, I owe you one.

Best regards,
Christian
