when mallocing main memory, you malloc(16 << m_cost), and I think it
should have been malloc(16ULL << m_cost)

Just my opinon, but it should be: malloc((size_t)16 << m_cost)

The size_t type is the correct type for the size of things in memory:
it is what sizeof returns, and malloc() expects. That way, you will
have a value of the appropriate type, without forcing a conversion.
