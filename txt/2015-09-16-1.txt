Subject: Argon2d vs Argon2ds GPU benchmarks?

The latest version of the Argon2 specs (1.2.1) proposes Argon2ds, a tweaked
version of Argon2d:
"
3. The S-box-with-multiply transformation (almost identical to Solar
Designer's MaxForm) is added to improve the GPU resistance in a new mode
Argon2ds. It is optional as well, and probably subject to change after we
test it on GPU.
"

Argon2ds uses the GenerateSbox function defined at
https://github.com/khovratovich/Argon2/blob/3d7566f4cdb64a8953b5aac71a3d7074ae27ae5f/Source/Core/argon2-ref-core.cpp#L153

Is anyone planning/willing to benchmark Argon2d vs Argon2ds? Would help
understand the actual benefits of this tweak.
