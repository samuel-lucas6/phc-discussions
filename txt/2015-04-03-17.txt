Tromp's construction was broken by David Andersen

Tromp incorporated Andersen's optimizations sometime last year. I'm
not aware of a more recent cryptanalysis of the revised work, the
assumption he's making now is that if there are no further
optimizations (knock on wood) then the properties he's going for will
hold.

(Breaking the current construction will apparently earn you some beer
money though!)

Cohen's idea is collision search; it is known to be performed

Yep, which was also what I pointed out to him too... He's gone of in a
fairly different direction since then.
