However, SHA-256, Blake2, and other hash

As far as I'm aware, no current code takes advantage of this as it's
incompatible with OpenCL and CUDA programming models, and as GPUs lack
ability to issue more than one instruction per cycle from the same
hardware thread (unlike CPUs).  Also, the parallelism available in those
algorithms is insufficient to make it worthwhile to introduce any kind
of data dependencies across threads.

Oh, I just realized you were referring to hiding the latencies, not
multi-issue.  You're correct, whatever (little) parallelism is available
within e.g. SHA-256 would help (a bit) if we were somehow too limited in
the number of instances of SHA-256 that we could run concurrently.
