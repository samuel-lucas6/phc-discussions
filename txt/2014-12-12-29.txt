Subject: Language & behavior on this list

I still read this list, and although it is not mine to run or moderate,
I am still going to ask somebody here to calm down. I want usable and
productive discussions, not stupid egos and "selfmade" vs "academic"
discussions. It doesn't benefit anyone.

I know first hand from running PasswordsCon since 2010, and many on this
list have experienced the same thing long before me, that when academics
and (for now I'll refer to us as...) security professionals meet, there
will be cultural differences. Clashes even.

As a former colleague said to me: "I'm pretty sure we agree in the end,
its just that we tend to use different words, technologies and
strategies to achieve the same goal."

Now Marsh Ray can write "I'm happy with answers received, thanks!", or
we can continue, but in the interest of achieving the same goal. Just
use proper language and explanations as we go along, shall we?
