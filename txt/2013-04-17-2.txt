Jeffrey Goldberg <jeffrey@...dmark.orgwrites:

This is mostly me whining. I just got bitten by the fact that PBKDF2
does weird stuff if you ask for more derived data than is natural for
the PRF you give it.

Perhaps this can be converted into a requirement for a nicer KDF: the
cost to compute one bit of the output should be as high as computing the
entire output?
