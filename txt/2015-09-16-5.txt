I'll continue to test the < 1ms hashing test case in L3 cache, just to keep
track of the difference it makes in that use case.  I'm not skilled enough
with GPUs to provide valid benchmarks there.

However, a major reason for Argon2ds is improved ASIC defense.
Compute-time hardening should be around 10X stronger.

This is critically important in the case where an attacker can fit the
memory on the same die, eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck.  Argon2ds
puts the multiplication chain on one serial operation in the scalar portion
of the CPU.  This provides somewhere around 10X stronger compute-time
hardening in an ASIC attack than just using multiplication in the modified
Blake2d, due to the faster scalar multiplier and the 8X parallelism in the
inner SIMD loop.  Future GPUs may be better able to take advantage of that
parallelism.
