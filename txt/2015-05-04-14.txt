While you're mostly correct, you're somehow omitting important detail.
As discussed before, salting may defeat side-channel attacks on password
hashes, as long as the salts are not known/predictable by the attacker.

this wording is actually accurate, because even secret salts does not
guarantee safety against side channel attacks. they *may* defeat them,
but may not.

Right.  I actually introduced that "may" deliberately when editing the
paragraph you quoted.

i understand that this scenario still isn't exactly "probable". and
using irreversible mixing functions early can thwart such attempts.
however for example lyra2 or pomelo, i would not tell at a glance
whether they can be traced backwards if the internal state is
partially recovered.

I agree with you on this.  The hashing scheme has to be specifically
designed such that "as long as the salts are not known/predictable by
the attacker", it is immune to side-channel attacks.  And ideally this
should be easy to see.  I think in (ye)scrypt it is easy to see (even
though in scrypt this probably wasn't a deliberate design goal).
