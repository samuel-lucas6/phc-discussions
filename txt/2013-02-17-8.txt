I am neither a cryptographer nor a hacker, so forgive me if this question
is naive. Any asymmetric scheme will require some secret key to be available to
the legitimate verifier at verification time (right?). And if so, shouldn't we 
expect that the same compromises that would get the password hashes would also get
at that secret?

Correct. You have to assume that if the passwords are compromised, the
encryption key is as well.
