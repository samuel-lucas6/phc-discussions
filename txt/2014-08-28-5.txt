Hi,

On the matter of parallelizability: our code does not allow
multithreading basically because we did not have time to implement and
test the "p" parameter discussed in the "extensions" part of the
documentation. :(

This is about to change, though, since we have been focusing on the
"extensions" discussed in the algorithm's proposal (mainly on how to
control the memory bandwidth up/down while adding parallelism). AFAIU,
the approach adopted in different from those of Yescript and Twocats, as
the parallelism is on the memory matrix level rather than on the level
of cells. There may be some (dis)advantages when compared to those two,
but we will only be able to tell after we finish our tests :)

BR,

Marcos.

TwoCats and Yescrypt are the most ASIC attack resistant algorithms in
the competition for hash sizes of 32MiB and up.  Lyra2 is a close
second, off by about 2X in my tests, only because Lyra2 does not have
a multi-threading option.

Here's why...

On my machine, doing 16-byte unpredictable memory accesses to external
DDR3 memory take 7.5X longer per byte.  Any PHC entry with no plan to
mitigate this 7.5X penalty will run quite a bit slower than Script!
This alone, IMO, limits candidates suitable for replacing Scrypt to
Lyra2, TwoCats, and Yescrypt.  A factor of 7.5X is important!

Any PHC entry doing unpredictable memory accesses that maxes out
external memory bandwidth will have decent ASIC defense.  This can be
done with large or small block sizes.  For example, Yarn, in my
theoretical optimized version, maxes out memory bandwidth to external
RAM when doing 1GiB hashes, and my ASIC attack gains only a 16X
advantage, because my ASIC attack 16 banks of RAM.  Memory bandwidth
hardening cannot defend against this any better.

However, my ASIC will still guess memory-bandwidth limited 1 seccond
Yarn hashes 3.25 times faster than Yescrypt or TwoCats memory limited
1 second hashes.  This assumes my 1GiB GDDR5 memory banks have the
same latency as DDR3, but twice the total bandwidth (assuming the same
bandwidth, we'd get back to a 7.5X difference).  Also, if the ASIC
uses lower-latency RAM, it gains a lot on Yarn, but almost nothing on
Yescrypt or TwoCats.

Lyra2 does have adjustable memory block sizes, which enables it to use
about half of my memory bandwidth with one thread.  It's pretty good
for ASIC defense!  With a threading "tweak", Lyra2 would be equal to
both Yescrypt and Twocats at providing the best possible DRAM
bandwidth-limited ASIC defense.


Here's two sets of cache tests.  The first does pseudo random reads,
writes, and read-then-write to different memory sizes.  The 16KiB
tests my L1 speed, the 128KiB tests my L2 speed, the 4MiB tests my L3
speed, and the 1GiB tests my DRAM speed.  The first run is for 16-byte
memory accesses, and the second is for 4096 byte memory accesses.
