Subject: Any "large verifiers" on the panel?

I'm not familiar with everyone on the panel, but I think it would be useful to have someone with an understanding of having to deal with a large number of legitimate authentication sessions.  Someone who, say, manages Gmail logins (IMAP, web, etc) may have insight into what sorts of cost parameters they would like to have.

Basically, it would be really sucky to settle upon a winner and then have sites and services say, "we won't use that because we can't manage our verification costs the way we need to."

Cheers,
