Companies will accept a transparency no-effort solution which improves
the password hash security of their users. The will not delete old user
data.

you keep mentioning deletion of user data. i restate that i was
talking about deleting password, not data. when the user comes back
after like a year of inactivity, he will simply be told that his
password was deleted for security reasons, and now he needs to go
through the usual forgotten password routine. users can also be
notified that in order to avoid this minor annoyance, they have to log
in at least every 6 months. that is not of anybody's concern. this
won't set your business back.
