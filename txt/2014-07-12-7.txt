Not everyone in the PHC panel agrees, but to me there's very important
distinction between contest (between people) and competition (between
PHC submissions).  In my work on yescrypt, I prioritized making a better
(in my opinion, not necessarily PHC panel's) and non-redundant
submission over improving yescrypt's chances to win.  I think most (or
maybe all) other PHC submission authors did the same.  There's indeed
correlation between "a better and non-redundant submission" and "better
chances to win", but these are not exactly the same.

Okay I agree non-redundant submissions are most useful.   I understand that
the goal of some is that the winner would end up being recommended for use
by NIST or similar.   To the extent it makes sense, is there a plan for the
"winner" to be revised to incorporate helpful parts of orthogonal designs?

Thanks for the feedback everyone.   I'll mention the competition!

Thanks,
Justin
