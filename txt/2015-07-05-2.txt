Sure, but this makes your 512 MB ROM sort of irrelevant for
GPU attacks. They can have that 512 MB in their GPU card's
RAM, and will run almost as fast (for a trivial enhancement
of scrypt) or just as slow (for yescrypt with pwxform).

You guys are making it sound like all GPU RAM has same performance characteristics.

Wrong impression.  You might want to read the 2 years of archives of
this list. ;-)
