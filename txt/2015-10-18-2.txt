Subject: Argon2 README

Hi!

Here's a draft README.md for Argon2:
https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/README.md

I briefly described what's Argon2 and how to use it, leaving the PDF
document as a reference for all details. I called the high-level API
"hashpwd" (formerly PHS) but we can probably find a better name.

The goal is that it takes less than a minute for a reader to figure out
what's Argon2 and to convince him to use it.

Please share your comments here or (better) make pull requests :-)

Thanks!
