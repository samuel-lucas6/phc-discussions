Subject: Re: Tradeoff cryptanalysis of password hashing schemes

As there are questions on this mailing list on how we got our energy & size
estimates, here is a short insight.

A naive (no tradeoff) implementation of a password hashing scheme on ASIC
with up to a GByte of RAM would use only a tiny portion of memory at every
step. When the memory is not used, it still consumes power to sustain the
state values. An energy-efficient adversary would use the memory that
minimizes the total energy spent: for reading, writing, activating, etc.
There exist low-power static RAM designs, of which the following two are
interesting (we used [1]):
[1] 850 MHz, 65nm design with retention mode leakage 0.1 mW (10^{-4} Watt )
per MBit and active energy (read/write) 0.0001 J (10^-4) per GBit.
[2] 333 MHz, 65nm design with retention mode leakage 0.00015 mW (10^{-7}
Watt ) per MBit and active energy (read/write) 0.0004 J (10^-3.5) per GBit.

1 GByte of [1] occupies 12,000 mm^2, and of [2] -- 5,000 mm^2. This is
certainly larger than the current CPU/GPU chip sizes (500-700 mm^2 for
recent Intel and nVidia designs), but comparable to largest CMOS sensors
(40,000 mm^2 and more) and  certainly smaller than a single wafer. In fact,
our own tradeoffs do not explicitly require all the memory being on a
single chip, but it should have reasonable latency (<5 cycles).

Quite clear, for different schemes and different tradeoffs an adversary
would employ different types of RAM, maybe more energy-efficient. So our
estimates give an upper bound. If you want to count the energy consumption
of your favorite SRAM or DRAM design in some particular tradeoffs, you're
welcome to submit the power numbers.

here is the link to the slides of the talk I have just given at
PasswordsCon'14. It investigates time-memory tradeoffs for PHC candidates
Catena, Lyra2, and Argon, and estimates the energy cost per password on an
optimal ASIC implementation with full or reduced memory.

Additional comment: It is a standard practice in the crypto community to
give explicit security claims for the recommended parameter sets so that
cryptanalysts could easily identify the primary targets. Many PHC
candidates do not follow this rule by not only missing these claims but
also concealing the recommended parameters. As a result, cryptanalysts like
me spend valuable time attacking wrong sets or spreading the attention over
multiple targets.

Remember: third-party cryptanalysis increases the confidence in your
design, not decreases it (unless it is badly broken). Analysis of a 5%-part
of your submission (one of 20 possible parameter sets) is little better
than no analysis at all. It is also worth mentioning that to make fair
comparison of candidates, benchmarks and performance discussion in general
should cover recommended parameter sets only.
