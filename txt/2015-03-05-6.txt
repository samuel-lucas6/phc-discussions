i think this turned out very wrong with bcrypt, which comes with the
recommendation of 10,

Where?  In my copy of the 1999 paper on bcrypt, only cost 6 and 8 are
mentioned (at the end of page 7) as OpenBSD defaults.

which most people carelessly adopted,

Here's what I found actually in use in 2012:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2012/08/09/20

"4-12 exist in the wild for password authentication, larger values are
sometimes seen for other uses (you may choose not to support such uses).

I think the defaults are as follows:

Solaris - $2a$04 once bcrypt is enabled (it is not by default)
CommuniGate Pro - $2a$05, ditto
OpenBSD - $2a$08 for root, $2a$06 for non-root
Owl - $2y$08 for all by default
openSUSE - $2y$10 for all by default

Google web searches also find numerous instances of $2a$12, albeit
mostly in discussions on use of bcrypt from scripts and such.

An example use other than password authentication:

http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1765/can-i-construct-a-zero-knowledge-proof-that-i-solved-a-project-euler-problem

This has $2a$16 and $2a$20 samples.

The paper and slides on scrypt compare it against bcrypt at up to $2a$16
("tuned for file encryption")."

despite on today's hardware it is rather small.

Depends on use case.  For mass user authentication, it is actually
pretty large.  Arguably, password hashing slowness should not become a
server's weakest link in terms of resource consumption DoS attacks.
(Of course, there may be countermeasures to such DoS attacks, and to
online password probing in general.)

I don't mean to argue with the main points you're making.  I actually
agree.  I primarily wanted to comment on bcrypt's costs in use.
