Of course, to make this machine worth building compared to the ASIC
up-front costs, an attacker would have to build a bunch of them.  This
seems like a government-scale attack to me, or maybe if EARWORM were
used in crypto-currency hashing.  This would be a super-fun machine to
build.  Maybe I'd make it somewhat configurable, like an FPGA, so that
it could attack different hashes than AES-128, and maybe different
algorithms than EARWORM.
