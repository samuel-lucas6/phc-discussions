Hopefully they will take some feedback for corrections.  They
mistakenly call Yescrypt non-RAM hard and lump it with Makwa.
They did not test it with significant men size either...

Hi all,

thanks to the authors for the benchmarking paper. Nevertheless, we do
not agree with the results for Catena since the authors in the paper
did not consider the current version of Catena (Catena v3.1) which can
be found here:

They refer to the version from December 2014 which does not contain
the latest tweaks such as:
 - reduced-round version of blake
 - additional random layer
 - changed initialization phase
 - removed SHA-512 from the parameter recommendations for the underlying
   hash function
 - ...

They also ignored the instance Catena-DBG, which was already mentioned
in the ePrint version. Before this paper will be used in the decision
process for the winner of the PHC, we would kindly asked the authors
to analyze the latest version of Catena (Catena v3.1).

They similarly used older versions of Yescrypt, Lyra2, Argon, and others,
if I am not mistaken.  I think this is no big deal for the non-finalists,
but  the paper should be updated to reflect the current state of all the
finalists.

It is nice to see some new independent analysis, though :-)
