 It's probably so easy to enumerate users on a system through timing,
it's almost worth giving up on the premise, and just provide a descriptive

Security is hard, let's go shopping! Well, hopefully if we actually give it
a decent go we can do better than Snapchat, or AT&T.

But seriously, I think the real solution here is server relief protocols.
It should be possible to use some fancy pants scrypt-like algorithm without
overwhelming your infrastructure by moving most of the computation to the
client.
