coherence and discourage holding back ideas, require that every round 2
submission have at least one round 1 participant listed as an author. From
there I think we can go directly to selecting winners. Unless we get a lot
more entries than I expect, culling the field down to a set of finalists
seems unnecessary. The revised timeline might look something like this:

Thoughts?

â€‹I think you'll be onto plums, Jean-Philippe Aumasson specifically said at
the end of November that the deadline wouldn't be changed (during a
discussion surrounding the deadline for the CAESAR competition).

Personally, I think the deadline is fine as it is: it's been advertised for
a year.
