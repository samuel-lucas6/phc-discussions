i was under the impression that the PHC function have
descriptive purposes only, not intended to be actually
used. it is a programmer's way describing how to set
up and invoke the alogrithm in a general way.

By having the same signature, it also allows test programs to swap out function pointers for maximally-fair comparisons.

While I too am shocked by the recent court ruling about APIs, it's hard to imagine it will be a huge impact on PHC. Jean-Philippe is "discussing this with qualified people".

Don't worry, we'll do the right thing.
