Steve - I think you haven't yet posted a clarification on my concerns
below, yet now this table made its way into Milan's revised report.

Please clarify what exactly you meant by "t_cost for 2x".  Thanks!

For yescrypt it's t = 2 to have it perform 2x the number of read-writes
compared to the total number of blocks.  t = 0 means 4/3, t = 1 means
5/3, and t = 2 means 2.  Then it's just whole numbers.

So if I understood you right, all of the numbers for yescrypt in the
table above should be decreased by 1.

... or are you only counting memory accesses starting with the point
where the memory is filled, and not counting the initial accesses
during memory filling (which often involves reads of previously-written
blocks, and thus contributes to the attacker's area-time product too)?
If so, your table is correct (for yescrypt; I didn't verify the rest).
