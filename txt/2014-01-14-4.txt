Memory.  If each pipeline stage requires 500MB of DRAM, then this gets rather expensive.

Looks like 500 MiB DDR3 is currently $4.22 retail. This doesn't sound cost-prohibitive to an attacker building their own custom ASIC. Pin count is likely to be the limiting factor in up-front costs, while power consumption costs are likely to dominate after few months of continuous operation.
