Subject: Search tool for Catena parameters

Hi.
As part of our effort on making Catena more accessible, we just
uploaded catena-axungia:
https://github.com/medsec/catena-axungia
This new tool allows you to define run-time, memory and
memory-hardness bounds and then searches for the optimal parameters
within these boundaries.
This is especially useful for setups involving exotic or restricted
hardware. It also provides a simple way to update recommended
parameters, which will obviously become necessary in the future.

Sincerely
Sascha Schmidt (on behalf of the Catena team)
