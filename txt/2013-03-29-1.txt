Subject: Testing Password Hashing functions

Hi,

What are the tools recommended to evaluate password hashing functions ?

Is a general purpose hash testing tool, such as SMHasher[1], a good 
tool to evaluate
general properties of a (password) hashing function ?

I'm also thinking of visualization, such as the graphics produced here:

- https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/avalanche
- http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/145633/86764

Do you know other test suite ?
