Did they already implemented C99?

That's built with /O2, maximise speed.

BTW, according to [1, p.4], they optimize "âˆ—p; if (!p)" starting with 
/O1. I guess MSVC would not be very good for compiling Linux kernel:-)

So while the Gnu folks are still accommodating one's-complement CDC 6600's
from 1965 (not sure if the 7600 was one's or two's-complement, but the later
Cybers and Cray-1 weren't any more), Microsoft have realised that INT_MAX +
100 = -ve on any known architecture.  It is somewhat disturbing to see that
LLVM is following the Gnu braindamage though...

I guess you will enjoy reading what MS guys think:
