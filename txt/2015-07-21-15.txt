Nice!  I was getting excellent multiplication-chain hardening with a
similar approach.  The scalar pipeline has a faster multiplier.

out
the best solution.

Switching Argon2 to use pwxform would be too much of a change - not
code-wise, but design-wise.  If we were to do that, then it'd be better
to go with (simplified) yescrypt or the like instead, which we already
have separately (just not as the PHC winner).

Got it.  In that case, I'm for the MAXFORM upgrade.  I agree that
Bcrypt-like GPU resistance is a critical defense.  For example, without it,
I would have to use Yescrypt in the PoW systems I've been playing with
rather than Argon2.  With MAXFORM, would Argon2's GPU resistance be as
strong as Yescrypt's?
