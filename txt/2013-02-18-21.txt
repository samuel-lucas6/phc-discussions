In typical C fashion, return value should be 0 for success, and
otherwise for any error that may occur during computation. Error codes,
if any, should be up to implementors, since sources of error may wildly
vary between schemes/implementations.

I was under the impression that the return value was the amount of data copied
to the output buffer.
