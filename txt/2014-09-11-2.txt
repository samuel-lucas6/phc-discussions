Subject: Makwa is broken given p and q

Given p and q you can do:
eÂ  = 2 ** cost
e' = 2 ** cost (mod (p-1)*(q-1))
x ** e = x ** e' (mod p*q)


You could pick the cost to be 2 ** 128. Without p and q you can't test a
password.
powConst = powm(2, pow(2, 128), (p-1)*(q-1))
hash = powm(password, powConst, p*q)
but you could just do HMAC(password, secretKey)

Sorry but even if you came up with the perfect server-specific shortcut, HMAC or
encryption with a secret key is better.

If you don't know the secret, it takes 3x longer.

If you don't know the secret, you can't do anything.
