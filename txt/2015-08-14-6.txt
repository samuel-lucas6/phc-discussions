Thanks Alexander!
For folks on this list who are interested and familiar with crypto, it may be faster to look at my tech report explaining the idea

Thanks.

As I said then. This is one of those really cool ideas that makes perfect sense once someone actually points it out. Iâ€™ve always been bothered by the fact that an attacker may just need to decrypt a single block or check a MAC while the defender needs to decrypt the whole thing, but I never really thought about doing anything about it. So thanks again.

Cheers,
