Most, if not all talks should already be uploaded by Adrian Crenshaw
(Irongeek) to Youtube. However he's missing some metadata that I will
provide to him asap.

We will also collect PDF for all talks and put them up on
passwordscon.org, eventually links to their locations. Same for a
Youtube playlist of all video recordings.

Best regards,
