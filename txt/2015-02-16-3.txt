I have a very candid question for Krisztián Pintér and Somitra Sanadhya:
Do you think there's a general process problem with the PHC, or do
you think specific candidates were descriminated against?

i have already answered that question, after ignoring like 3 similar
accusations. let me find that for you. here it is:

"this is not the first time a panel member pulls this cheap trick to
call us sore losers to discredit criticism. guess what, even if i'm a
sore loser, the criticism must still be answered in a meaningful
manner, to avoid, you know, the impression that it might be true."
