Another dumb idea - Scrypt2?  Of course that would only make sense
with the blessing of the author of Scrypt.  I frankly don't know this
crowd or their relationships, so I have no idea if that is possible,
but but it gets around the LiteCoin people.  I googled it, and it
looks like it is not claimed by anyone.

Thank you for all those ideas!

Rich Felker suggested what I think is the winner: escalcrypt.  No hits
on Google web search for this one, none at all.  Of course, this will
change soon after I send this message, and that's fine.  So chances are
that escrypt will become escalcrypt.
