  To ease the hashing process, Argon2 allocates the same amount of memory
for each thread. Therefore, when you request 9 or 10 KB of memory and 2
threads, 8 KBytes will be used in fact. The output values will be
different, of course, as the requested 'm' is hashed as well.

Great!

And about parallelism. It seems it's now allowed to be up to 255 but one 
place in the spec is not updated: "Parallelism. Argon2 may use up to 64 
threads in parallel, although in our experiments 8 threads already 
exhaust the available bandwidth and computing power of the machine."
