h = fastHash(password, salt)
for u = 1 to upgrade
{
  h = fastHash(slowHash(h, t_cost, m_cost))
  t_cost = increaseTCost(t_cost)
  m_cost = increaseMCost(m_cost)
}
return encrypt(h, key) // HSM? :)
You are totally right. I don't know how I missed this. The most
embarrassing thing is, that this would already be possible with
Catena. The only thing missing is the server-side finalization with
encryption.
I hope I haven't caused any confusion with my previous mail.
