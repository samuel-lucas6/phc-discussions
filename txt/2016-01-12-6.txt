i don't recall if i posted this to the list, but if not, i swear i'm
not making this up after this article :)

so i'm long since against pseudorandom but fix access patterns. first,
i don't see the benefit of a pseudorandom but fixed over a simple and
fixed. it is still fixed. second, i see the risk that anything chosen
randomly might be suboptimal. especially if it depends on a value
(like salt) out of control. i don't like their approach for the same
reason.

analogy: s-boxes. it is known, that random s-boxes are suboptimal in
comparison to carefully crafted ones. this is the expected thing,
since why would a random object be optimal? it only happens if the
vast majority of possible objects are optimal, which at least needs a
proof.

this is why i like catena's more scientific approach, or yes, my own
for that matter.
