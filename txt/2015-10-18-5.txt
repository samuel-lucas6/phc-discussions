So we'll accept a same encoding for instances whose implementations has a
different structure. Unlikely to be an issue I guess.

Number of threads is a runtime parameter that doesn't affect output, so it
doesn't really need to be encoded; it's up to
the system configuration/implementation to figure out what the optimal
thread count should be. Lanes, on the other hand,
must be there.
