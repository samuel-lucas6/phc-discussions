Hey everyone,

First of all, thanks for all the feedback and opinions on the AntCrypt
submission and sorry for the late answer(s).

Let me try to address the latest questions and doubts below and keep
the discussion running :)

Cheers,
Ralf Zimmermann

On the discussion on the floating point operations:

I must admit that I had not previously considered floating point
in this context.

I agree that the use of floating point operations is an unusual
approach for cryptographic primitives and we had a lot of discussion
internally as well. The decision to use them was made very late
(that's why we submitted shortly before the deadline) and we put them
as ideas into the function list and source code to start a discussion
about it - which worked surprisingly well and fast. :)

There are certainly some (minor) disadvantages with respect to 
ensuring correct rounding behaviour and minimizing entropy loss, 
but thanks to IEEE those should be manageable problems.

We did neglect to specify some important details, for example the
rounding mode and the precision, which are both important for
portability. We should have used (and written about) the IEEE 754
definitions and might have avoided some of the doubts.

Of course, we should have added this to the reference implementation
as well (my fault, I quickly wrote it down), i.e., using the
fesetround() function and verify which operations in the math library
are IEEE conform *cough* to estimate the impact on the portability.

Any more feedback, discussions and ideas on the use of floating point
operations is very welcome.

Calling library trig functions is bit too optimistic though.
Very true, we did not check about the precision and iirc trig
functions are not covered at all by the IEEE standard (?). We will
check this and probably have to remove them, if there is no standard
covering them.

But pulling in FP also means that you can pull all the
"non-giraffe mathematics"[1] into the cryptographic playpen.

Think about the potential Mandelbrots fractals or The Lorentz 
Attractor has as "dial-a-hardness one-way functions[2][3].

It probably is about high time that we eject the "integers-only" 
dogma in the non-symmetric parts of cryptography.

Thanks to AntCrypt for inspiring that thought.

On the effect of the construction on GPU/FPGAs:

Clearly he'll have to change his functions to eliminate the trig. 
Either that or provide software versions that always yield the same
result. He did say that he may want to update the function list in
the "tweak" period, so I think he should be allowed to move away
from the trig stuff, and maybe floating point all together, and
replace them with more portable simple one-line functions like the
ones he has.
We hope that the discussions here and our own tests will provide a
good set of such functions and other ideas we did not think about.

Apart from that, we should try to evaluate if the scheme itself -
given a set of "good" functions (however we define them) - is usable.
Of course, the functions have an efficiency impact in the end, but we
hope that the surrounding construction is strong enough.

That said, while the pseudo-random function sequence may frustrate 
current GPUs (does it?), it wont be a problem for FPGAs and ASICs 
that will simply compute each in parallel and have a mux on the 
output to select which one is next.
I don't know about GPUs. The construction should lead to forced
branching, which will slow down the GPUs. As this is bound to
happen a lot, we hope that the slow-down will have a visible effect.

For FPGAs, it will still be annoying, as it uses up LUTs and makes the
routing slightly worse. Of course, we could increase the effect by
putting in more complex functions into the pseudy-random function
sequence, and/or by changing the datapath from 32-bit to 64-bit or
128-bit.

An implementation will be restricted by the construction however, as -
like you said - you need to evaluate all n functions (however many we
will have in the end) in a sequence. Thus, you need area for every of
those functions. That is no big deal as the functions are small, but
you also need to spend at least n clock cycles (no latency for FP
operations) and cannot easily make use of a fully pipelined design due
to possible collisions in subsequent calls.

The second aspect are the multiplexers. Every function needs to have:
1) an input multiplexer to choose between the memory output (state[j])
and the result of all other functions.
2) a control signal to choose the appropriate input from the mux

In the current version, this control signal takes one out of all
outputs and uses some bits from the selected signal, taking another
multiplexer and logic (as every function must be executed only once),
adding to area and the critical path. (*)

These are all small things, but they will get annoying if you try
to utilize your FPGAs as good as possible, as the effect on the
routing increases.

Also, the author may be mistaken about how large floating point 
operations are in silicon now days.  A 64-bit multiplier is at 
least half the size, if I'm not mistaken, of a floating point 
multiplier with a 64-bit mantissa.  Multiplications are good, 
though.
I looked at the double precision tables for the existing Xilinx IP
Cores. Depending on the availability of DSP hardcores and the latency
setting, the implementation is not too small.

But I must admit, that I did not have time to implement an FPGA design
yet, which we should do for benchmarking in any case.

With the limited memory (32 KiB is suggested), it also is a target 
for the multi-CPU thingies.
You can always adjust the memory by increasing the m_cost parameter. I
think we wrote 32 KiB (?) as a suggested minimum.

To be honest: we did not write a real recommendation, as we also lack
the GPU implementation of an attack, and only after both FPGA and GPU
attack are benchmarked, we can optimize and tweak the construction.


Apologies to the author... sorry, you were at the top of the list.
Don't be, we are glad to get feedback and improve the construction :)

Bill


(*) Please note that this is a data-dependent branch using "secret"
data and we are currently waiting for internal feedback on a possible
change here, which keeps the "pseudo-random" sequences but where the
data does not depend on the secret state.
