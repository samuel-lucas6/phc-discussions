PMULLW is 8 packed 16x16->16.  I felt that if we go for 16x16, we
probably want to take the upper 16 bits of result (so PMULHW or PMULHUW
or PMULHRSW), not lower, although this does make the signedness matter.

We'd need to compare ASIC circuit sizes for lower vs. upper 16 bits.

Actually, mostly not sizes, but number of levels, as you've nicely
illustrated by your examples of multiplying by a constant.
