Hi Thomas,

Thank you for your work on this!

Another method would be to go straight for the compiled kernel format,
which is supported as an option by OpenCL; in the case of AMD GPU, this
appears to be some kind of ELF object, but not fully documented. Some
people are trying to write such an assembler:

but, as far as I know, this is not completely usable yet.

FWIW, we have some more info on this on the wiki, but it was buried on
the archived GSoC ideas page... so I just moved it to its own page:

You might be interested in the collection of links to GPU assembler
projects, for different AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.  For AMD GCN, I'm afraid
the Windows-specific assemblers are the closest to being usable.
However, for NVIDIA Maxwell, MaxAs might already be usable, and it isn't
Windows-specific.  (Yes, we need to add a Maxwell card to HPC Village.)
