Great, thanks.  Back on topic, my #1 request for PufferFish would be
having a 4KiB-ish block size with a user-defined repeat count, after
which it would be mixed with another 4KiB block.  This could L1-cache
compute-time harden the algorithm while being effective against GPUs,
couldn't it?  With a low repeat count, it could hash a lot of external
DRAM.  I like the simplicity, but busting out of L1 cache seems
problematic.

P.S.  My #1 request for Escript (sorry, again off topic) would be a
SkinnyCat-like stripped down version of the essence of your favorite
parts of the algorithm.  I got mine done in something like 30 hours,
so there's still time.
