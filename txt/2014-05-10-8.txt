That said, I believe it is necessary to clarify intellectual property
terms on the PHC website. I will discuss this with qualified people,
and will add the relevant statements to the website. Hopefully next
week.

i was under the impression that the PHC function have descriptive
purposes only, not intended to be actually used. it is a programmer's
way describing how to set up and invoke the alogrithm in a general
way.
