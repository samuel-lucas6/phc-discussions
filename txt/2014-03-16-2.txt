Yeah we identified a need for better password hashes and the SHA3
Competition just finished so I thought that was the right time for a
password hash competition. I threw the idea on Twitter and many more people
quickly joined the project.

Not quite. Poul-Henning Kamp (who is on this list), the author of
md5crypt (not MD5), stated that md5crypt should no longer be used
because it is too fast on today's hardware, and as it has a fixed
iteration count, there's nothing to be done about it except use
something else.

This did not prompt the PHC, however, since most operating systems had

What prompted the PHC was simply all of the major password breaches in
the last couple years, combined with this tweet from JP:
