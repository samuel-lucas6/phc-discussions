Subject: Design Rationale and Security Analysis of PHC candidates

We have prepared a small survey of the design rationale and security
analysis of the PHC submissions. It should help the committee to evaluate
the candidates and the community to see the status and potential strengths
and weaknesses of the candidates.

We are welcome to any feedback. We plan to add further information to the
tables, possibly in the spirit of Microsoft criteria.
