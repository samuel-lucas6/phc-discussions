If we cannot depend on proper key management for high-risk, scalable

for password storage like HMACs (in specialized circumstances) so frowned
upon by some of the crypto community, when key management is fundamental to
so many other aspects of secure systems?

â€‹Adequate key management and distribution is arguably the most challenging
problem in cryptography today, e.g. TLS relies on that very shoogly peg
that is certificate authorities, and we're still using passwords -
essentially low entropy fixed tokens - for most end users.

If you can solve the key management problem in a usable and scalable
manner, you're a better man than I :-)
