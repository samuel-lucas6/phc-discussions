converting the result hash, and optionally any parametrization, to
a string is perpendicular to password hashing. it can be added
later, it is straightforward, it is independent of the actual
algorithm, and it can be supplied as a helper function to the core
hash function. my conclusion is: we should not discuss it, it is a
waste of time.

side note: does anyone know why bcrypt packs only 23 bytes of the
24 byte hash into the string representation?

- From a valuable Solar Designer comment in his implementation of
bcrypt, it appears to be a bug in the original bcrpyt, which all new
versions have to implement faithfully.
