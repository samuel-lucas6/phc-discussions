Hey Marsh,

We should have abstracts & bios up by the end of the week, or maybe this
weekend.

Irongeek will be handling AV production this year, so the videos this
year should be much better quality. We are unsure of live streaming at
this time.

In the meantime, there are expected to be some presentations at Passwords14 (Aug 5-6) that are directly relevant to PHC. It was a great conference last year and I encourage anyone interested in the topic to attend if able.

Last year the slides were up quickly and the video was up on a well-known video sharing site within a few days.

We're currently preparing to decide on the list of finalists, and we want to be careful about it, so don't expect to see the result until early autumn or so.

Input and observations on the candidates are of course still very welcome.
