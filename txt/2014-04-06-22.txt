No, this is incorrect. The `hash' variable in this context is not the
raw hash value, it is the encoded hash plus the hash identifier and
encoded salt string.

it might need some clarification then, what the intended use of PHS
is. as i interpreted it, "out" should be raw bytes of length "outlen".
that poses the question though, what if a scheme does not even produce
anything that could be called "raw value" (e.g. it produces two
numbers in a prime field).

i would suggest to include a little memo for all candidates, what can
we expect from the output, is it random, is it a struct, etc. i added
that to Gambit, but i won't resubmit for this little change, it will
be there with the next significant update.
