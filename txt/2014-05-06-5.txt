Also remember that password hashing functions are tuneable, and that page
loading (on the internet) takes time. It might be better to compute the
hash in the background, while sending the user all the resources which are
shared between the success and failure pages, and then dynamically load the
success/failure page as needed. Also, for most things a huge security
margin isn't needed, adding a tenth of a second to a login is barely
noticeable but still provides significant security benefit.

Well, I did call it a "dumb" idea :-)  I get inflicted with them a lot.  I
agree... it doesn't seem like there's much to be gained with such an
approach.  I was hoping someone might see a way to get around the
precomputed prefix problem.  I haven't found one.
