It is generally a good idea for the network to defend itself against DoS by requiring incoming node connections to submit a costly proof of work A that's cheap to verify, just to accept the connection. If this measure is effective, it allows use of proof of work B that's costlier to verify for actual block verification. If a node submits an invalid block, disconnect it and require it to go through proof of work A again if it wants to re-connect.

Of course, this requires some proof of work A that's cheap to verify and still not trivializable. But the incentives to attack proof of work A (which merely gates connections) are much different to incentives to attack proof of work B (which underpins the currency).

I haven't thought this one all the way through. I don't know how to assign a budget to this one, other than "the cheaper verification is the better".
