Subject: Where do authors get these numbers?

Just saw this:

https://www.cryptolux.org/mediawiki-esc2015/images/3/32/Proceedings_esc2015.pdf#page=13

Looks like a ton of good effort by a lot of good people, but there's a
table claiming TwoCats generates only 1.26 bytes/cycle on a Haswell CPU
compared to some lame speed by their algorithm.  Huh?

I just measured it on a similar CPU at 0.46 cycles/byte   There are
trade-offs,, and speed isn't everything.  It just happens to be fun :)
 Sorry, but the authors here made a mistake.

I guess I can't get mad about other peoples mistakes.... that would be
seriously hypocritical.
