I think the point of a consistent API should be that "proper" parameter  
choice is consistent across algorithms, and never possibly "wrong". If you  
have to special case your parameters for a given algorithm, or avoid  
certain inputs which are otherwise commonly used, then arguably that's a  
bug in the underlying algorithm.

Would not the "perfect" API take as its singular cost input a dollar value  
(bikeshedding aside), to then select the most effective algorithm, given  
the hardware at its disposal, to imbue said cost with the least amount of  
latency?

I don't mean that literally, but the goal of the API is to provide the  
necessary levers to efficiently imbue cost under the given hardware and  
latency constraints -- without allowing the operator to shoot themselves  
in the foot.

I think valid / "minimally secure" inputs MUST be consistently defined, or  
even further, all valid inputs MUST be "minimally secure".
