- The types Argon2_i, Argon2_d, etc, should be commented in the code.  Few
programmers will bother reading the documentation, so the code has to be
understandable on it's own.  There needs to be some comments to help the

True. We'll add that

- I think the Argon2_id mode is currently equivalent to Argon2_d.  There's
no place in the reference code where Argon2_id is used.  The reason the
vectors are different is probably because the type is hashed into the
initial derived key, as it should be.

Oops, it is a bug, the Argon2_id code got lost somewhere on the way. Will
fix ASAP.

Overall, this seems like outstanding work.  Thanks to everyone in the
Argon2 team for delivering a first rate solution!
