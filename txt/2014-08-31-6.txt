Hash: SHA1

The Microsoft presentation made a good point that stuck with me: users
hate dealing with all these different parameters like m_cost and
t_cost, and they'll just stick with password and salt if we can't
simplify storing hashes in a database.

I'm reviewing PufferFish right now, which has includes code for
packing/unpacking parameter as a string.  I think this is important
enough of an issue that the PHC should recommend an additional
interface that takes this string and password as the only hashing
parameters, and where the string is suitable for storage as an ASCII
text field in a dataabase or password file.

I really don't think the Microsoft guys understand the PHC entries
very well, but they do seem to understand users.  For entries moving
to the next round, I'd love to see a new requirement for a function
for packing/unpacking these strings.
