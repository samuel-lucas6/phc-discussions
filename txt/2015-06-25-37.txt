And based on my experience working in companies, security policies
are rarely so good that side channel attacks make up a large fraction
of your risk level.

Things are changing with cloud. It’s the biggest shift in business computing I’ve seen since the personal computer. Shared CPU multi-tenancy is the new norm.

i guess it would, but adds one more round of communication, and also
removes the benefit of not needing the password ever leave the client.

The client needs to request the salt either way, so it isn't saving a round.

all this hassle just to be able to use something that should not be
used in the first place anyway.

I've always been on the cache-independent bandwagon, I'm just feeling that some of these arguments against cache-dependent candidates are getting a little close to FUD.

Performance efficiency
Data independence
Time-space-area hardness

None of the candidates give all three, it seems like we can only get two. And based on my experience working in companies, security policies are rarely so good that side channel attacks make up a large fraction of your risk level.
