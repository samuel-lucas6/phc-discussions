Hum... That makes me think we need to include bcrypt in our GPU
benchmarks and see what happens. I'm not a GPU specialist, but we do
have a person working with the GPU implementations and the results shown
in our report (Sec. 7.3, Figure 20) are that, in the best conditions
from an attacker's perspective and for a memory usage of 2.3 MB, the
GPU-based implementation was 4.5 times slower (in terms of throughput)
than in the CPU.


Typically when attacking bcrypt, CPU is the preferred platform. Current high-end GPUs are roughly the same speed as older high-end CPUs with bcrypt, and are a fair amount slower than current high-end CPUs.

Using bcrypt with cost of 05 (as traditionally used for benchmarking):

R9 290X:     7 KH/s
GTX 980:     7.5 KH/s
Xeon X5670:  8 KH/s
i7-5960X:    14.5 KH/s
