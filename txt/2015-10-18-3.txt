Subject: Argon2 string encoding and parallelism

Just noticed that the string encoding defined by Thomas has a single
parallelism parameter whereas Argon2 supports distinct number of lanes and
number of threads, which can't be encoded with a single parameter. I don't
think that's a problem though, I don't see many reasons why implementations
wouldnt have #lane=#threads.
