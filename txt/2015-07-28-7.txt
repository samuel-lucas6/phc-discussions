Subject: Re: [PHC] Finalizing Catena, Lyra2, Makwa, yescrypt

I would love to see a variant of Catena refactored as a framework that can
work with other memory-hard hashing algorithms.  For example, Catena-Argon2
would provide several features missing in Argon2, and Catena-Yescrypt would
also provide some new functionality.  Features in Yescrypt and Argon2 that
are already in Catena could be removed to simplify them, and some features
that we need, such as encode/decode parameters to a string could be added
in one place.

If Catena were refactored as a generic framework, I think I would use it in
most applications.
