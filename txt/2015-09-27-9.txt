In Makwa, at least, it is preferable to have a binary identifier for the
used modulus (in the current spec, it is a hash of the modulus,
truncated to 8 bytes). This parameter does not map to a non-negative
integer (well, you _could_ make it an integer, since every sequence of
bits can be interpreted as an integer, but you see what I mean).

Another case would be PBKDF2, which is configurable with an iteration
count, an output length, and an underlying PRF (usually HMAC with a
given hash function). The hash function name could be made part of the
function identifier (i.e. you have 'pbkdf2-sha1', not 'pbkdf2' with a
'sha1' parameter), but, conceptually, you could make the hash function
one of the parameters (as a symbolic string).

Then perhaps negative integers could be excluded?
