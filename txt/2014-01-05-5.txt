Maybe it should be like:

2014 Jan 31: Call for submissions initial response is due (must provide
the name of at least one author and at least a provisional name of the
password hashing scheme to be submitted; no other info is required yet)
2014 Mar 31: 1st round submissions due
2015 Q1: 2nd round submissions due (must have at least one author in
common with a 1st round submission; minor tweaks are still permitted
after this time)
2015 Q3 (exact date to be announced): freeze: further tweaks are no
longer permitted (exceptions may be granted by the panel in case an
easily fixable issue is found)
2015 Q4: selection of one or more password hashing schemes

I support this proposal in preference to my original one.
