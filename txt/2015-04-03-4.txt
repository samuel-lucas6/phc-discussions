Can we estimate the number of transistors needed for a naive multiplier
(minimizing solely the circuit depth)?  60,000 / 1024 partial product
bits gives us 60 transistors per bit.  Perhaps half of them would be
spent on the first set of additions (since 1024 is close to
512+256+128+64 = 960 inputs to further additions).  If so, we have 30
transistors to spend on one full adder, which is more than we need -
which is 8 to 22, from what I could find.  Of course, we wouldn't use
ripple-carry adders, but 30 transistors per bit feels about right for a
carry look-ahead adder.

I made an error here.  1024 bits need only 512 full adders for the
first set of additions, so we have 60 transistors per full adder there.

So the circuit size appears on par with the naive one (and their fastest
one is probably larger than the naive one).  Clearly, so much effort was
put into this not just for the sake of weirdness.

With the above correction, my estimate is that the 60,000 transistor
circuit is maybe twice larger than a naive one would have been, and
the fastest circuit from this PhD thesis is 3x larger than a naive one.
