Subject: Supporting AVX2/SSE2 or not with a single binary

One reason I think we see applications running without SSE/AVX2
support is that operating systems don't want to support two versions
of a binary, and they have to support older machines.  The Blake2 code
I've read does not provide for a single binary that supports both - I
have to link either to the blake2-ref code or the blake2-sse code.  My
TwoCats code has inherited this limitation, since I used the Blake2
code as a roadmap for figuring out how SSE2 works.  These guys over on
StackOverflow think they've got code to detect SIMD support and allow
a single binary to support both:

How cool is StackOverflow?  So, is this the right way to build
high-speed crypto binaries now days?
