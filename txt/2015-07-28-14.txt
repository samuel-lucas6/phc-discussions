Thanks for the link, Bill. But after the list of hashes is sorted, a
collision with a specific hash could be detected with an O(log n) binary
search, more quickly than an O(n) linear search.

Once the hashes are sorted, we can generate all the expected O(n)
collisions in a linear pass, testing each for passing the difficulty
threshold.
