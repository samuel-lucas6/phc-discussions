There are a few entries that are difficult to fit into the PHS interface.
 For example, Parallela has two time parameters that are bitwise OR-ed to
form t_cost, though I would have prefered that he just use m_cost (an
unused parameter) as the second time cost.  Several others have multiple
hard-coded constants to set various features to default values.  Maybe a
generic dictionary (attribute list) should be part of the interface to set
those parameters.  I'm not sure.
