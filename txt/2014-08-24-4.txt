Two things:

First, Solar Designer is right.  Picking optimal hashing parameters
involves no "safety margin".  If you hash less memory because you are
overly concerned about TMTO attacks, then your algorithm does a worse
job than it should at protecting passwords.  If you hash more memory
because you are not concerned enough about TMTO attacks, again you do
a worse job protecting passwords.  Our job is to make such trade-offs
to help any given password to be as secure as possible.

Second, I think you need to develop better insight into hardware that
attackers can build today before worrying too much about the future.
For an ASIC attack, your proposed read/write times are way to fast,
and the die size for your proposed multi GiB on-chip cache would be
several square inches.  We simply can't build such chips.  Your theory
that SRAM will save you power is wrong.  No one-transistor DRAM cell
is going to leak more power than a six-transistor SRAM cell.  The
reason we use SRAM instead of DRAM on our ASICs is that ASIC processes
optimized for logic speed rather than gate leakage, and because SRAM
cells are far faster to read than DRAM cells.  Even so, DRAM has been
making inroads into ASICs, partly because it reduces power.  Your
estimate that static power loss dominates heavily over dynamic power
in the RAM when constantly accessed at maximum speed is simply wrong.
 You need to find an ASIC designer to help you with these estimates.
