Alexander's time cost parameter is used in a way that seems to increase

understand things right, there's some ratio of Lyra2 t_cost to Yescript
t_cost where both have roughly equal TMTO resistance.

Yes, I think so too.

In case an unexpectedly effective TMTO attack on yescrypt is found, it
may be remedied by recommending a higher t, which is already a tunable.
(So this may be done at any point in the future, for future yescrypt
hashes, while retaining compatibility.)  Since t=1 and t=2 have only
slight impact on normalized area-time (reducing it to 96% and 89% of
optimal, respectively), they may be chosen over t=0 to gain extra TMTO
resistance, if desired.  At this time, though, I think t=0's TMTO
resistance is sufficient.

It sounds like Lyra2's defaults correspond to lower normalized area-time
(something like 50% of optimal?) than even yescrypt's t=2.
