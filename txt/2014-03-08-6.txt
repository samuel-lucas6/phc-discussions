It is sort-of an IETF standard... the situation is a lot more hazy than you
describe, there's a lot of supposedly-informational stuff that is in fact a
universal standard, including HMAC itself (RFC 2104).  The reason why some of
the informationals are informational is because there's no standards group to
publish them under, and they're pan-standards-groups (HMAC, for example, is
used all over the place, SSL/TLS, CMS/SMIME, IPsec, and many others).

The motivation for publishing HKDF was a reaction to this everywhere-but-
nowhere problem, every little standards group invented their own KDF, all
incompatible, with very little, if any, rigorous analysis.  HKDF was intended
to provide a single, universal KDF to sort out this mess.
