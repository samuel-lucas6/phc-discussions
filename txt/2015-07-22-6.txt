No objection here.  I would be surprised to hear any.


@Bill, Solar (and others): blamka and maxform, respectively in Argon2i and
2d, is that what you have in mind, of maxform in both?

I think I would prefer maxform in both, with the regular reduced-blake2 in
both, although using blamka in both would also be OK.  I'm a big fan of
maxform with or without blamka, and also I would prefer to keep Argon2i
similar to Argon2d, preferably merging the algorithms into 1.  Even though
the addressing in Argon2i is predictable, I do not see any easy way to use
in a GPU against maxform, though I'm no GPU expert.
