Counterargument: If there's a need to do this, then the Argon implementers are
going to do a much better job than some random developer who isn't even aware
of side-channel attacks, let alone how to deal with them.

+1.  PKCS #7/CMS/PGP/etc already do this for you, so you don't need to encode
parameters yourself.
