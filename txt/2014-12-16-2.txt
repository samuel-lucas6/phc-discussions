When considering the potential of state level attackers  (consider: A
_single_ F-18 fighter costs around $30 million dollars) concerns
around amortization and architectural gap reduction seem pretty
material. (Keep in mind that there are publicly known state operated
general purpose computers with over 1 petabyte dram).

A simple PBKDF2 has a strong argument for the minimum energy cost to
attack it, not just on a desktop but for the best possible attacker
barring any computer engineering or mathematical breakthrough.

Against state level attackers you might need a KEYED password hashing
scheme, since a low entropy secret is no match against those kinds of
attackers. A password that is protected by a 256-bit key should
withstand even state level attackers (e.g., NSA).

The state spends billions of dollars for espionage. Thus, I doubt that
the energy cost to recover a 40-bit secret protected by PBKDF2
matters at all.


BTW. At page 24, of our current Catena specification [1] we proposed a
keyed password hashing approach that thwarts off-line attacks.
