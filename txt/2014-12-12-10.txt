If commonly chosen passwords have an incidence of, say, 0.5% in a database
(not unreasonable from what I can tell), there is a suitably large number
of hashes in the database, and the work involved in calculation of a single
hash is high then it might be of use.  For example, a database with 1m
password hashes implies around 5k duplicates of each of the very most
common passwords; if those aren't salted then an attacker can both reduce
their work commitment by the number of duplicates but also readily identify
them a priori as weak passwords.  It does however require the work-per-hash
to be rather onerous indeed.

Back of the envelope for birthday collision.
Random password with 32-bit entropy (~6 alpha-numeric) - 77 thousand
passwords = 50% chance of duplicate
Random password with 48-bit entropy (~8 alpha-numeric) - 20 million
passwords = 50% chance of duplicate
Random password with 64-bit entropy (~11 alpha-numeric) - 5 billion
passwords = 50% chance of duplicate

And from (https://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/)

    4.7% of users have the password password;
    8.5% have the passwords password or 123456;
    9.8% have the passwords password, 123456 or 12345678;
    14% have a password from the top 10 passwords
    40% have a password from the top 100 passwords
    79% have a password from the top 500 passwords
    91% have a password from the top 1000 passwords

Critically, 0.18% of users use 99.6% of the passwords in the database
leaked in that article.
