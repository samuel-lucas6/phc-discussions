Sorry, but I'm not qualified to comment on the mathematical strengths
or weaknesses of Makwa.

For an excellent overview of Makwa, you can look at Thomas Pornin’s
talk at PasswordsCon.

I am even less able to comment on the math, other than the fact that once
I read up on it I found it really cool.That squaring over Quadratic Residues
is a permutation is one of those remarkably counter-intuitive results that
makes me wish I’d studied Algebra. 

I was initially skeptical of delegation, as it seems like adding a great
deal of complexity for a feature of limited use. But the more I think
about the fact that a busy authentication server can delegate allows the
defender to allocate resources in a way that isn’t constrained by so many
of the annoying practical constraints that typically apply solely to the
defender.

It is not a
memory-hard password hashing scheme, which I consider to be a
weakness, and also why there's not much for me to review. 


I agree that the lack of memory hardness may well kill the bear (Makwa),
there is enough unique solid stuff in Makwa that I would like to see it
or its ideas continue to be considered. (I’m not on the committee; I’m not
qualified to be on the committee; and perhaps “wow, that is really cool
math” is not the best of reasons to select something.)

Cheers,
