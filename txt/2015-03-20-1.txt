Hi,

Openwall is a mentoring organization in Google Summer of Code 2015, and
we have some PHC-related tasks listed:

http://openwall.info/wiki/ideas#John-the-Ripper-support-for-PHC-finalists

These are not getting enough interest yet (there's more interest in the
SIMD support enhancements for JtR task, as well as in the radare tasks),
so I thought I'd promote them some further and in the right place. ;-)

Here's our announcement of Openwall being in GSoC 2015:

Student applications are now open (via the Melange system) and will be
until March 27, 19:00 UTC.

Alexander
