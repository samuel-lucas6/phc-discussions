Subject: Re: An argument for Catena-2

After all the benchmarking, I take back my argument for Catena-2.  I
think Catena-2 may not be strong enough.  There may even be an
argument for Catena-4, but the one thing I feel confident about is
that Catena needs a sub-Catena graph embedded in the first row.  This
dramatically improves it's defense against TMTO attacks.
