That is indeed how the later stage SHA-3 reports are done. However, I went
back and looked at the SHA-3 Round 1 report
[1], which would be the rough analogous to the phase we are in right now.
There is no comment on the 37 rejected
candidates beyond some initial generalities about criteria (which, as you
pointed out, were mainly security and
performance). I am quite confident each of these rejections are fully
justified, but the report is definitely not where
one will find them.


I'm sure NIST tried quite hard with the SHA-3 competition, but the reality
(at least IMNSHO) is the entire process was a debacle that resulted in a
highly contested, poorly-received candidate which was selected before the
PHC started... *and yet* still has not been fully standardized by NIST.

The result of the process was probably the first time in history that we
may see non-NIST hash functions receiving widespread organic adoption
because the SHA-3 competition was so poorly executed and the selected hash
function is simply not what the wider community is interested in using.

I'm sure there's hard won knowledge from the SHA-3 process that we can
incorporate to PHC, but at the same time I look at SHA-3 as a sort of
antipattern for how to run a crypto competition.

I think the PHC can do better (and is doing better).
