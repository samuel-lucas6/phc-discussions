Hi,

The 30C3 starts in a couple of days. It might be a good opportunity to
give an lightning talk about the upcoming PHC to encourage people to
make some optimized implementations of accepted (round 1) candidates.

At least we can to a lightning talk to rise the awareness of this event.
 What do you think?

BTW. It would by great to have one of the organizers on stage. Any
volunteers? :-)

Casting my vote for Jean-Philippe here. :-)

BR,
Per
