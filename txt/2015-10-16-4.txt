Subject: Re: Argon2 PHC release...

Samuel and I did a number of fixes to
https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2. If you clone this repo and run
./test.sh you should get OKs for all the tests. Or not; please let us know
then.

I've started a basic README at https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2,
which will contain usage instructions (copying from
https://github.com/khovratovich/Argon2). Any suggestion or contribution
welcome :-)

Did a couple more tweaks, including a usage() function
https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/src/argon2-test.c printed
when no argument is given. Still a lot to do here, and ideally we should
use getopt for this rather than manual parsing.
