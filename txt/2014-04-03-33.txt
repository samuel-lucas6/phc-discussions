Agree with Dmitry. Ideally submitters should be on the ML, and that's
their own responsibility to register and follow the PHC activity.

That said, I will check who's already registered, and it's probably
reasonable to email those not registered that it might be a good idea
to subscribe. (Will try to do this by end of week.)

If you have a serious attack, it is recommended to contact the designers first to ensure you got it right.
