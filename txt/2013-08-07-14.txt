I heard from Daniel Selifonov that the AES-NI are actually faster than saving the
expanded key in memory. Anyone know if the AES-NI run in constant time?

"Beyond improving performance, the AES instructions provide important 
security benefits. By running in data-independent time and not using 
tables, they help in eliminating the major timing and cache-based 
attacks that threaten table-based software implementations of AES. In 
addition, they make AES simple to implement, with reduced code size,
which helps reducing the risk of inadvertent introduction of security 
flaws, such as difficult-to-detect side channel leaks."

Gr√∏stl was a finalist in the SHA-3 competition which was able to benefit from AES-NI.
