ROM-in-RAM (such as the 112 GiB I was testing with) can be viewed as an
anti-botnet feature.  It's not that large that it won't be stolen, but
it can be large enough to buy a few years of botnet resistance.  It's
practical to keep authentication servers' current ROM-in-RAM (for newly
set/changed passwords) 16+ times higher than a typical botnet node's RAM
size - e.g., it can be 128 GiB in server vs. 16 GiB or less in typical
botnet nodes now.  (I don't know what their actual RAM sizes are now.
I guess typical is actually below 16 GiB at this time, although newly
added computers probably do have 16 or 32 GiB of RAM now.)

Oh, obviously 128/16 = 8, not 16, but overall the point holds. ;-)
