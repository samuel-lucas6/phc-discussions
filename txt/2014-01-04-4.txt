Hi Bill,

there is no template for submissions, so feel free to format in MarkDown.

That said, depending on how the algorithm looks like, a TeX-generated PDF
may yield more readable specifications (e.g., if you need math symbols,
equations, etc.).

Best,

JP

This is a dumb question... sorry!  The requirements say there should be a
cover page and several specific sections.  Is there a template available
for LibreOffice, or should I just wing it?  My preference for document
editing is vim, and MarkDown, so if there isn't any preference on the
receiver's side, I'll probably just send a .md file.
