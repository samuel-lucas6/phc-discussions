(Also, if I understood Agnieszka correctly, Lyra2 had the advantage of
AVX2 in its benchmark on CPU, whereas yescrypt was plain AVX only.

Correction: no, this was not correct understanding.  Neither uses AVX2
in this benchmark.

OTOH, yescrypt can be sped up by only ~6% with AVX2 on this CPU with
yescrypt's current pwxform settings.)
