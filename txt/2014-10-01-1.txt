Hi.

I'm not sure whether "attacked" applies to the 'Tradeoff analysis" of
Lyra2: originally there were no claims on attacks involving half of the
memory usage, but only against a very low memory usage.

We do have such claims in the new version to be submitted (assuming
Lyra2 moves to the phase in which such tweaks are allowed), and the
attack venue described does not seem to be effective in that case.

Also, the "FPGA/ASIC defense" does not take into account all tweaks
described in the documentation, although I agree with "attacked" if you
consider only the basic design and ignores this part of the document.

Anyhow, very interesting analysis!

BR,

Marcos Simplicio

We have prepared a small survey of the design rationale and security

the candidates and the community to see the status and potential strengths
and weaknesses of the candidates.

We are welcome to any feedback. We plan to add further information to the
tables, possibly in the spirit of Microsoft criteria.
