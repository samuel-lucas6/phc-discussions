Both of these things (and many others) are happening.  It is non-obvious which
is more common.

My bad for speaking in absolutes. Of course nothing is. Can we agree that a
COPY TO STDOUT of a users table does more damage (and is easier to perform)
with less risk of being caught/stopped in time than does network MITM, and
that based on virtually all of the compromises that have become
(semi-)public, assuming that the former is the more common isn't completely
unreasonable?
