POMELO's submission document doesn't use the words "key derivation
function", but it does claim collision resistance. But if you can find a
sequence of inputs which causes the outputs to fails the
diehard_birthdays test, then obviously you've reduced its collision
resistance to at least something less than 2**(outlen/2) (for outlen
expressed in bits). In this case, inputs of 0, 1, 2, 3... did the job.

In the case of POMELO, the output does not change base on the password
(due to a 2-line bug).  So, since people keep asking for demonstrated
input:

candidates./phs-pomelo -p one 1 1

1c a4 39 75 93 02 41 dc
15 f4 69 c1 55 1c b8 c0
a1 4a fd c2 e7 a3 e1 a8
e3 95 db 82 0c 97 26 d9      32 (octets)

candidates./phs-pomelo -p two 1 1

1c a4 39 75 93 02 41 dc
15 f4 69 c1 55 1c b8 c0
a1 4a fd c2 e7 a3 e1 a8
e3 95 db 82 0c 97 26 d9      32 (octets)

The two line fix to lines 47 and 48, so that the salt does not
overwrite the password, makes dieharder happy with POMELO output.
