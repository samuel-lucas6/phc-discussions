Definitely needed. Any help welcome :-)

@Dmitry: were you planning to add this to the A2 specs?

interest in specifying a modular crypt format to supplement the final
specification for Argon2?

My opinion is that such a specification should really exist, and,
preferably, be included right into the "official specification" (maybe
as an appendix) and into the reference implementation(s) as well.
Lack of a definite, standard format indeed always leads to a plethora
of incompatible formats that cause severe headaches down the line
(e.g. when switching implementations but reusing an existing database
of hashed passwords).

If the Argon2 authors do not have time for that, I can contribute the
specification and code if needed (I have not written anything to that
effect yet for Argon2, but I did for Makwa, so I believe I can do that
job properly).
