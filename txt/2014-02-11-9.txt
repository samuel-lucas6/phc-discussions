Having submitted my NoelKDF with it's multiplication compute-time
hardening, I am now wondering if the compute time we force an attacker
to spend matters at all.  An attacker will simply add password hashing
cores, which are close to free, to his FPGA or ASIC, until his memory
bandwidth is full.  If I force him to spend a full second to write and
then read 4GiB once (which I do), he'll just run 5 of my hashing cores
in parallel on an FPGA and fill it's 40GiB/sec memory bandwidth, doing
5 guesses per second, so who cares that I forced him to spend as long
as me computing the hash?

The attacker will need more memory, right?  Interleaving between
different passwords increases bandwidth, but it proportionately
increases the amount of memory needed, I think.
