Yescript: The is surprisingly little in the Yescript code that seems
inspired by Catena.  I think Alexander is a fan of client-independent
update, but I don't see support for it in the code.  Perhaps Solar Designer
feels worse about using other people's good ideas than me.  He does have
server-relief, but it's an extended version meant to be nearly compatible
with SCRAM.

I can add cost upgrades (client-independent updates in Catena terms)
without breaking compatibility with yescrypt's current hashes.  I intend
to add this maybe in the tweaks period.

I also intend to add cache-timing resistant mode(s).

The reason these things aren't in there yet is that I focused on core
functionality first, whereas I view these as nice extras.  I simply
didn't have time for these extras without impacting my work on the core.
I also feel that yescrypt is complicated as it is, so having even more
functionality in there might be counter-productive for initial reviews.

I have no problem using other people's good ideas, with due credit and
as long as the ideas aren't patented - e.g., yescrypt builds upon scrypt,
and a future version will likely optionally use Catena's bit reversal.
