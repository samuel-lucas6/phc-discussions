I just googled Alexander and SolarDesigner so I could use your full
name in my credits.  Holy cow!

Darpa should just write you checks and ask politely that you tell them
what you're up to now and then.  Thanks for all the time you've spent
educating noobs like me on this discussion list.  No wonder you code
and ideas kept blowing me away... and here I thought you were some
young guy busting his butt to make a name for himself...
