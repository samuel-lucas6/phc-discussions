Thank you for responding.  I think at least knowing that those things
are "largely out of scope" is helpful to us.

Some people, like John Tromp, have been exploring the space of other
kinds of POW functions that achieve properties like using memory
hardness while minimizing the harm against other considerations here;
but this is specialized work and heads off in a very different
direction than PHC. (I have doubts about how worthwhile those efforts
are either, but at least they're done with a careful mind to the
application requirements and tradeoffs by someone who understands
them).

FWIW, here's an attempt at an asymmetric memory-hard PoW by Bram Cohen,
the inventor of BitTorrent:

He's also been interested in what we're doing here in PHC:

Maybe some hybrid approach would work best for cryptocurrencies that
want to encourage CPU mining: use a memory-hard PHC candidate (or the
like) at fairly low settings (but not to the point of the area cost
being negligible) as a building block in an asymmetric memory-hard PoW,
like what Bram described?  For example, a 2 MB symmetric hash expanded
to a 2 GB asymmetric PoW.  That way, possible flaws of the asymmetric
memory-hard PoW would be partially mitigated by use of the likely better
understood symmetric memory-hard hash.
