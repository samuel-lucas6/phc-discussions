+1

To me the overall goal of the PHC is improving the state of password-based credential handling in the world.

Recent data breaches have done a great job raising awareness of the problem.

Now the PHC can use all the attention we can get as we go about providing a usable high quality solution.

my opinion:

1, drawing attention to PHC is always good.

2, bringing new information is always good. if you have new points, new insights, new analysis, sure, tell everyone. actually i was hoping for much more analysis and discussion about the candidates.
