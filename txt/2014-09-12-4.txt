Also interesting is what happens with 1 MiB per hash:

6 rounds, 4 threads: 6300 6 rounds, 8 threads: 7300 2 rounds, 4 
threads: 13400 2 rounds, 8 threads: 14550 to 15400 (unstable 
speed)

As expected, this makes 8 threads the optimal choice again.  The 
speed and bandwidth usage difference between 6 and 2 rounds 
improves to 2x+. Of course, like before this is countered by the
3x reduction in compute hardening per hash computed (so up to 1.5x 
overall).

When AVX2 code is written, it will improve speeds at 6 rounds 
slightly (but less so at 2 rounds).

I think I prefer the 2 round vs 6 round for this PoW application.
Designing fast multipliers is hard, but so is designing 2MiB fast
SRAMs.  Doubling the SRAM bandwidth and cutting the computation speed
by 3X seems like a reasonable trade-off to me, especially since you
also gain speed in block chain verification.

I might be tempted to increase to 4MiB though :-)

Here's one problem I have with GlobalBoost-Y.  It sounds like a dream
come true for botnet operators.  Can you think of anything to defend
against botnet GlobalBoost-Y mining?
