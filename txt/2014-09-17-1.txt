Subject: omegacrypt and timing

can someone explain me how omegacrypt does not leak secret through
timing? i mean total runtime, not cache timing.

in the central part, we derive 0..3 number B from the secret, and
based on that value we do different branches that has different number
of operations. B will on average have all possible values with the
same probability, but there will be a deviation. therefore for two
given passwords, the total running time is different.

i understand that memory latency screws up such fine grained timing,
making practical attacks difficult. but theoretically there is a leak.
am i right?
