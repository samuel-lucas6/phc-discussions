It is in fact the case that no password hashing algorithm can well protect
these median-entropy passwords against an off-line attack.  With even a few
KiB of memory, we can improve over PBKDF2 (with Bcrypt for example), but
1ms of _any_ algorithm is not enough to slow down attackers much once they
have the password hash/salt database.  Your user passwords will be revealed
no matter what 1ms password hash you apply.  Therefore, addtional security
measures are required.  That's all I'm saying.

​On that count, we seem to be fairly much in agreement.​

And if the PHC winner can improve over existing well-used PDFs in
constrained resource setups, even by a small amount, it's worth using: over
large password databases as it arguably brings a benefit.
