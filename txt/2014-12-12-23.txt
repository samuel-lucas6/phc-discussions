This makes absolutely no sense. How exactly does one start attacking
hashes before having the hashes?

Clever. Really. Except my superiority is not an illusion; my expertise
and reputation speaks it itself. But I've never heard of you. So I ask
you: who are you, and what qualifies you to speak with such authority on
this topic?

It's overwhelmingly obvious who on this list actually cracks passwords,
and who just reads papers about cracking passwords. From where I'm
sitting, if you're not a password cracker, you really don't carry any
weight in a conversation about cracking passwords. Especially if you
don't even understand how password cracking software attacks salted hashes.
