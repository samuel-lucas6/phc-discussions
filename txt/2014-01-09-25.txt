Do you really want to allocate 1GB of RAM on a tablet or smartphone to
perform the login process? A lot of those devices have less then
1GB of RAM. In general I'm not convinced that a significant amount of
useres/admins are not pleased with a login process that
allocates a huge amount of the systems RAM. On many host, such a
solution will virtually enforce swapping. Just saying. :-)

It's one of the reasons why I like time-memory tradeoffs. A device with less RAM
can tune down the memory cost, increasing the computation time.

I think most devices should be able to afford at least 100MB per CPU core.
