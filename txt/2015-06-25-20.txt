With proper design, where the secrets are passed through a fast
cryptographic hash first (that is not itself susceptible to side-channel
leaks), the answer to your question above is:

Essentially none, as long as i and j are large enough (e.g. 128 bits
each) and s and h are cryptographically random.

In fact, to fully defeat the attack, it is sufficient to have s or h;
it is not necessary to have both.  (In practice, it may be helpful to
have both for other reasons.)

how many calculations, n, per hash you can observe

This becomes irrelevant.

and, obviously i and j.

Yes.  At least one of these must be large enough.

That would give you a rough idea of the resulting search space(s).

Under your scenario, the search space(s) are trivially made so large
that the attack can't advance at all.
