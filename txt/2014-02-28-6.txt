Subject: Future CPUs and GPUs?

I have been reading some rather interesting discussions here and while all this is useful to work out algorithms, what jumps out at me is that it is a discussion of today's GPUs.  

Admittedly the PHC is to protect [short-lived?] passwords so long-term protection is arguably not the top priority, but this whole exercise is aimed at choosing a standard, or at least a set of best practices, either of which should have a useful life of 10+ years.  

All crystal balls are fuzzy at best, but in five years, what will be the likely GPU configurations and specifications at the knee of the cost/performance curve?  ...ten years?  

Adjustable parameters will help, but how will proposed algorithms faire against future GPUs?

Thots?
