The reason these things aren't in there yet is that I focused on core
functionality first, whereas I view these as nice extras.  I simply
didn't have time for these extras without impacting my work on the core.
I also feel that yescrypt is complicated as it is, so having even more
functionality in there might be counter-productive for initial reviews.

Sounds good to me.  I was actually thinking that such functionality could
be provided in the API wrapper for the PHC submissions.  Functionality we
could add there includes:

- "strongly secure" PRK derivation (which we'd pass as the password to PHS)
- Client-indpenented updates
- Server relief
- Clearing the password before calling PHS
- Dealing with salt encode/decode

I almost wish someone had submitted such a framework with a pluggable
password hashing algorithm, maybe something like Catena without the Catena
algorithm inside...
