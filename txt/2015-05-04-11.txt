Having spent much of my academic life on performing cryptanalysis, i.e.,

doesn't quite convince me, though.

I just recalled an earlier discussion in here where Christian Forler
felt it was OK for Catena to absolutely rely on salt uniqueness for a
feature, and I felt otherwise:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/612/focus=659

While uniqueness isn't randomness, the similarity is in strong reliance
on a property of the salts.

I think this shows my pragmatism.  When this kind of reliance isn't
absolutely required for a security feature (there was another way to
specify the feature in question), I am against it.  When there's a
tradeoff between a not-yet-practically-relevant weakness and a currently
practically relevant one, I may well choose to accept the former and
mitigate the latter.

Arguably, this also shows Catena team's inconsistency. ;-)  If it's so
bad to rely on some historically not assumed property of salts (e.g.,
with crypt()'s 12-bit salts occasional collisions were assumed), then
just don't, for anything.

Oh, I just took a look at the actual code in Catena, and I see that
there's "uint64_t uuid" separate from the salt.  So at least this
reliance is made clear.  OK.
