Do you get transparent hugepages when you run your code on it?  Maybe
check /proc/meminfo with your code running vs. not.  And compare that to
what you observe on the FX:

I found an AMD FX 8 core CPU at work and benchmarked there.  I almost
exactly reproduced your data.  The difference has to be the machines.  I'm
just not sure what the difference is.

It could also be the Linux kernel version/config.  At these allocation
sizes, the kernel does play a role.
