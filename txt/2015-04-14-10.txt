I approve.

Yes.  Quoting my reply to you on the panel list on February 3:

"I'd expect complaints from other finalists.

This is unfair to them in that they had expected their more-than-tweaks
would not be accepted, so did not even try to submit such.  It would
have been preferable for us to state that we'd be willing to accept
"major changes" rather than merely "tweaks" when we announced the
finalists in December, if we're in fact to accept Argon2.  Then it'd be
fair to other finalists.

However, given the actual finalists we have, I would be surprised if
they actually wanted to make major changes.  OTOH, I was surprised by
Argon2 being introduced.  So I could be wrong.

With just 9 finalists, one way to handle this is to ask authors of the
remaining 8 whether they have objections.  I don't, so this leaves 7 to ask."

... and we've just seen Catena's approval as well, so only 6 left, if we
choose to use this approach.

Let's see what other panel members have to say.

Yes, and other submitters too.
