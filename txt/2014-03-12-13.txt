I hope you meant the other guys, because at least for this kind of
thing, my help is worth less than you paid for it!

No, I meant you, and I said "trying". ;-)

I knew of JtR before I knew you were it's author.  That's an amazing
brand.  It freaked me out when I learned you wrote it.  Is there a way
to use that brand?  It will sound goofy, but something like JtRCrypt?

I'd prefer a name for escrypt that would derive from and hint to its
qualities, not refer to who's behind it.  A reference and homage to
scrypt would be appropriate, though.  JtR is not terribly relevant.

Any other ideas?

Alexander
