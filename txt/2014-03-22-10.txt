they also won't use expensive password hashes or forward secrecy.
except if the customer demands it. not necessarily in form of a piece
of technology they don't even understand. but for example in form of
badges. imagine something like "Forler Security seal of approval". if
it has value, and sooner or later it will, those profit oriented
companies will start using everything you say to them.


OK. Assume company X sells a very successful userDB. For to the sake of
PR. they change the every decade the default password hashing algorithm
(PHA), eg, version 1.0 is shipepd with md5crypt as default PHA and
version 12.0 with sha512crypt as PHA.

Suppose X has done a great job and replace md5crypt hashes with
sha512crypt hashes when possible, i.e, each time when an old user logs
in, her md5crypt hash will be converted into an sha512crypt hash.

Unfortunately, the md5crypt password hashes of inactive users are not
updated. :-(

Users/costumers of userDB are not really involved in this process.

Companies will accept a transparency no-effort solution which improves
the password hash security of their users. The will not delete old user
data.

There are many userDB which contain password hashes of several PHAs
(NULL-hashes, crypt-hashes, md5-hashes, md5crypt-hashes, ...).


BTW. You can replace "userDB" by "operating system" or any other thingy
which stores password hashes.
