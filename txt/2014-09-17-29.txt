Then you do not seem to understand what Threat Modeling is.

a model not chosen in accordance with physical reality is worthless.
if your modeling excludes side channel attacks for whatever reason,
when those are in fact feasible, your model is not a good model of
reality, and your data will be compromised. do you disagree with this?
