Subject: PHC finalists announcement

On behalf of the PHC panel, I'm happy to announce the finalists:

Argon
battcrypt
Catena
Lyra2
Makwa
Parallel
POMELO
Pufferfish
yescrypt

These 9 submissions were selected based on criteria including, in no
particular order:

- defense against GPU/FPGA/ASIC attackers
- defense against time-memory tradeoffs
- defense against side-channel leaks
- defense against cryptanalysis
- elegance and simplicity of design
- quality of the documentation
- quality of the reference implementation
- general soundness and simplicity of the algorithm
- originality and innovation


Furthermore, we attempted to include algorithms relevant for most target
applications of a password hashing scheme, from web service
authentication to client login or key derivation.

We invite everyone---submitters of finalists and non-finalists as well
as non-submitters---to contribute to the final PHC phase and help the
panel assess the finalists, before the selection of one or more winners
in Q2 2015. Contributions may be

- benchmarks of the finalists
- implementations
- cryptanalysis
- bug reports
etc.


Finally, a disclaimer: the selection of finalists is neither a
recommendation nor an endorsement for usage in real applications; also,
minor changes ("tweaks") will be allowed, therefore the final versions
of the algorithms may differ from the current ones.
