haha! Well, let's agree that we disagree on a number of issues.
However, I do respect your code.

With the due respect to Keccak, which is a great design, its own authors recognize that it "excels in hardware performance", while it "has overall good software performance" (http://keccak.noekeon.org/). Since we normally consider hardware as an "attacker's platform" in the case of a PHS, Keccak does not seem to be the silver bullet in this case. 

Or, if it is, then a PHS is more like a Werewolf (pardon the pun :-) )
