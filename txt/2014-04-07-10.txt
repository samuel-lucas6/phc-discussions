By the way, in order to test Catena, I had to make a one-line change:

diff --git a/Catena/code/src/catena.c b/Catena/code/src/catena.c
index 8c84f82..5316045 100644
--- a/Catena/code/src/catena.c
+++ b/Catena/code/src/catena.c
@@ -283,7 +283,7 @@ int PHS(void *out, size_t outlen,  const void *in,
size_t inlen,
        unsigned int m_cost) {

   return __Catena((const uint8_t *) in, inlen, salt, saltlen, (const uint8_t *)
-                 "", 0, t_cost, MIN_GARLIC, m_cost, outlen, REGULAR,
+                 "", 0, t_cost, m_cost, m_cost, outlen, REGULAR,
                  PASSWORD_HASHING_MODE, out);
 }

Without this, all m_cost values under 18 result in an error, and with
an m_cost of 18, it takes too long to generate a GiB of data.  Would
it be OK to check in this change along with the other changes I've
made to PHC entries to get them to compile with a common main.c?

Your change is fine since we already recommend to set "min garlic" =
"current garlic".

Best regards,
Christian
