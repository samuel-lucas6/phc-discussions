Yes, that's my understanding too, but it remains undefined how
significant those "reasonable and organic enhancements" can be.

I'm not sure there is any way to define it concretely. I think it's
something that will largely be at the discretion of the panel, if based
on nothing more than gut reaction. If the majority feels that a change
is too dramatic, we can simply reject the modification.


In the case of escrypt, it might be that its underlying structure would
stay mostly the same, but the feature set might double.  I've been
postponing work on all those bells and whistles like hash upgrades
(despite of having suggested hash upgrades myself), focusing on
escrypt's core first.  So now I have to choose between finalizing and
properly documenting only the core (hopefully a complete submission but
with only a subset of intended functionality) vs. adding the bells and
whistles (but then the core will need tweaks later, and the
documentation will be incomplete) vs. continuing the work at its natural
pace and not submitting to PHC.

Just submit what you have, and continue to work on it. We'll work out
the details later :)
