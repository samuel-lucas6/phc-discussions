I can understand the frustration of those whose submission was
rejected

this is not the first time a panel member pulls this cheap trick to
call us sore losers to discredit criticism. guess what, even if i'm a
sore loser, the criticism must still be answered in a meaningful
manner, to avoid, you know, the impression that it might be true.

to summarize your arguments so far:

1. private discussion is better, because it can be less restricted

2. there is "no time" to summarize the points that came up.

see where i'm coming from? you can't have the cake and eat it too.
either you decide to do the debate publicly, or you decide to write a
summary of it.

you seem to choose a third option: announce the winners with a sorry
excuse of a report, and hope nobody will complain.


ps: just to be absolutely clear: i never expected Gambit to be a/the
winner (though definitely not for the reasons you gave so far). it is
perfectly okay for me to go down in a fair fight. but i can't stomach
how things go.
