Great, thanks Thomas, will review.

If the code turns out to be a formal reference it'll need to mention your
copyright and any public domain-like license you like (CC0, WTFPL, etc.).

 binary (encoded in Base64); the key ID is up to 8 bytes, while the
 associated data is up to 32 bytes. When they are empty, they are omitted
 (i.e. there is no difference in encoding between "no associated data"
 and "associated data has length 0").

The code includes some generic Base64 encoder/decoder (about 150 lines),
then code specific to Argon2i (about 200 lines), and some test vectors.
The Base64 code is constant-time with regards to the data contents (no
data-dependent table lookups or branches); this is probably useless in
most situations, but easy enough to achieve.

This sample code is meant to give some discussion basis about

rules (i.e. do everything you want except blame me).
