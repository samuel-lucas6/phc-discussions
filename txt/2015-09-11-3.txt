Well, my post still holds, on the fact that having an account with AM
doesn't prove anything "illegal" by itself. Unless of course having an
unverififed account with a dating service by itself is morally wrong.
Legally its not afaik.

The amount of passwords cracked by @CynoPrime however, and their current
estimates says they will crack 90-95% of all the passwords - for all
accounts, I have no doubt AM have completely FUBAR their password
storage implementation.
