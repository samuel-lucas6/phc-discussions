Subject: [PHC] Can we add back Argon2id?

Argon2id was in the winning algorithm of the competition, but afterwards,
in version 1.3, it seems to have been dropped.  Because data-independent
algorithms remains an active area of research with new attacks and defense
being published fairly rapidly, I cannot recommend Argon2i as the "default"
algorithm to anyone: there may be yet another attack or improved defenses
that make alternatives significantly stronger, and all purely
data-independent algorithms have worse memory*time defense in any case.
However, Argon2id has has no published attacks, and is basically as strong
as Argon2d against offline attacks.  I can comfortably recommend it for
most x86-based applications, other than small-memory in-cache hashing (very
common for servers) and applications that absolutely require 100%
side-channel resistance (like some security keys).

Without being able to recommend Argon2id, I am left without a default
algorithm to recommend.  I'd switch to Yescrypt, which I feel provides
stronger defenses in several important ways, but people really just want to
use the winner.  It is a far easier sell.

Can we add back Argon2id?

Thanks,
Bill
