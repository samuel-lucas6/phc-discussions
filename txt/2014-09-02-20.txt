I think I see a typo on line 107.  The code looks like:

        for(i = 0; i < (memcost / statelen); i++)
        {
            for(j = 0; j < statelen; j++)
line 107 -     state[j] = memstate[j * (i + 1)];
            revolve(state, statelen, 2);
        }

Every time we execute the inner loop, we overwrite the results of the
previous revolve rounds.  Did you mean to XOR memstate into state, or
overwrite state?  In my TMTO attack, I only kept 256 values of the
last memory pass.  Also, did you mean to access a block of 64 adjacent
locations in the inner loop, or is accessing addresses which are
multiples of i intentional?

The multiples of i adds some defense against TMTO attacks, once the
bug is fixed, so I recommend keeping it, though there are more TMTO
resistant access patterns.  If you want better off-line brute-force
attack resistance, I'd make that loop access memory locations that
depend on the password, like Scrypt.

Just quickly analyzing your TMTO resistance with the XOR fix, f I use
256 pebbles, and have them on 256 memory locations at multiples of
i+1, then at the end, my pebbles are at 0, memcost/statelen,
2*memcost/statelen, 3*memcost/statelen ...
(statelen-1)*memcost/statelen.  The total pebble moves is at most the
sum of these = statelen*(statelen-1)*memcost/(2*statelen) =
(statelen-1)*memcost/2.  However there's usually a pebble already half
way between an old pebble location and the new one, so I get another
2X.  For statelen == 256, that's an additional computation penalty of
about 64 full memory recomputations.  Versus the defender that's
around a 17X recomputation penalty for attackers using only 8KiB of
memory.
