Subject: Re: [PHC] Different cost settings and optional input

Agree on the first point. On the second point, I think he is suggesting
that you would have to save some of the initial input, but there is no
reason that you wouldn't be able to apply the hypothetical construction to
its own output to increase the required work per verification (similar to
how some developers are currently upgrading MD5(pwd) to bcrypt(MD5(pwd)) to
increase cost without requiring users to log in.)

09:29:32 gat3way | "Ability to transform an existing hash to a different
cost setting without knowledge of the password."

cost to 1 then attack the hash :)

*more* expensive versions

Of course, jchillerup is right. I think we should update the CFS to
make that clear. In a world full of wrong or partially wrong
information troublemaker can simply abuse this lack of clarity to
create an Illusion of a weakness in the PHC hash. Such an Illusion can
easily cost its credibility.

than the password then?

I am not sure what his concern is about. I think it is the following:
We allow the use of a "optional input":

It is possible that a coder who is using the PHC hash in his
applications misuse such an optional parameter intenionally or
unintenionally. For example by storing the entire plaintext or parts
into it. At least we should write a note about not doing that or even
better completly not allow the use of an optional parameter.
