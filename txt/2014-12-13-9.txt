 Joking aside, if you have a unique "deliciously-salty-", truncate the MD5 to
24 bits, and implement a good rate limiting system you'd probably have a
pretty secure system. Good enough against online attacks, but not so good that
you are giving up someone's password if you leak hashes. [weak passwords are
still weak, and leaks from multiple sources for the same UID would eventually
give up a password]

Huh? Maybe I don't get your sense of humor. You do mean this as a joke, right?
Because with IPv6 it's common to get a /48 which gives you 2^16 subnet prefixes
(so 2^80 IP addresses if the limit is not per subnet prefix). Just using the
subnet prefixes you only need to try 128 passwords per subnet prefix before you
are expected to get a collision. Obviously you can buy more servers and/or
subnet prefixes. You use to be able to buy a /32 for no reason at all (this
would be 1/512 passwords per subnet prefix for a collision).

I'm not saying rate limiting is dead because of IPv6. It just severely messes
things up.
