Subject: [PHC] yescrypt design rationale presentation

Hi,

I gave a talk at BSidesLjubljana earlier this month, and here are the
slides (and link to video):

http://www.openwall.com/presentations/BSidesLjubljana2017-Yescrypt-Large-scale-Password-Hashing/

Abstract:

In this presentation, the problem of password hash cracking is framed
as largely that of cost amortization, and thus the problem of password
hashing as coming up with affordably costly and amortization-resistant
password hashing schemes.  In this context, rationale is given for both
scrypt's sequential memory-hard hashing and yescrypt's numerous
additions to it.  Finally, application of yescrypt to mass user
authentication is demonstrated.
