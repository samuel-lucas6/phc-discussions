OK, two or three characters then. I was thinking about how I choose my own passwords. :-)

But I think my point remains, a 10x improvement for defenders is probably achievable with stronger requirements and/or better server tuning.

Just to add to the discussion: NIST does have attempted to measure the number of bits
a character would have in its SP.800.63-2, Appendix A
(http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-2.pdf)
By their estimates, each character adds ~1 bit of security after we pass the threshold
of 8 alphanumeric chars, even if we assume that the system validates that the
password is not in a dictionary and follows good composition rules (see Table A.1).
These estimates may certainly be too pessimistic (and I tend to believe so), but, by their analysis, 3 bits is a lot :)

I really do think they are being a little too pessimistic, at least for the purposes of our discussion. Especially we remove from consideration the (typical) 50% of user passwords that are so weak that no work factor acceptable in practice is going to save them.
