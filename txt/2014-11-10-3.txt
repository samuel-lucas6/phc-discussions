Yes, and yes.  256-bit (32 bytes) is a special case usable for
yescrypt's builtin support for "server relief".  For other output
lengths, that functionality is not applicable, so the corresponding
post-processing is bypassed.  For uses of yescrypt that don't care about
"server relief" (which most of them won't), this should not matter.

Ah, missed this. Thanks for explanation!

(yescrypt-lite will probably only support 32 byte output, so will invoke
those code paths unconditionally.)

>(and not my mistake) then probably PHS() should fail for other req. output

Why?  The PHC call for submissions doesn't say anywhere that PHS()
output for a shorter length should be a prefix of its output for a
longer length.  In other words, the requested output length might or
might not affect any/all output bits.

Yes. But the "32 bytes special case" is IMHO confusing.

In fact, now that you bring this up, I think a slight improvement might
be to always have the requested output length affect all of the output
bits, even if just to avoid any confusion of this sort ("hey, there's a
special case here").

Exactly! I think if it is dependent of output length then it should
be for the whole set. But just my 2 eurocents... :)

Thanks,
Milan
