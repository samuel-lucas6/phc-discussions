The last PHS submission I read (because of it's position in the
alphabet) was Yarn.  He didn't submit his code with the PHS prototype,
which annoyed me, because I'm trying to compile it.  There's no
Makefile, no main function, indentation by tab (one keystroke) and
there's not one freaking comment in his code.  Grr...

I did resubmit with the PHS prototype (before the deadline, of course),
but for some reason the first version was used rather than the second
one.

What are the odds that he messed up on his Blake2b or AES
implementations, which seem to be written in his style, so I'm
guessing he wrote them from scratch?  I'm not going to take that
bet...  I did check his initial key derivation.  I'd say at least
1/3rd of the entries have obvious input collisions, mostly from doing
H(password || salt), which allows trivial collisions by moving the
boundary between password and salt.

I've checked both AES and Blake2b against known outputs, so they are
most likely correct.

If I am not mistaken, he has input collisions on both salt, and a
parameter called "pers".  Both are padded with 0's to 8 bytes, and
XOR-ed onto Blake2b state, so adding additional 0's up to a total
length of 8 doesn't change the output.  The password is free of such
collisions, so this isn't a critical issue.  He also has a spelling
error on the last line of his README 

Blake2b has exactly the same kind of collisions. Even Blake has only
fixed-width salt.
