I second that. I do not use Twitter and I do not monitor IRC. The only
discussion I will see or participate in is this mailing list. I think
a lot of people from the academic side would say the same.

I think it's a matter of general netiquette that if you have something
to say [about an open source project, IETF document, etc.] that's of
enough substance that it should be preserved for posterity, then you
should say it on an archived mailing list. However, people *will*
violate this rule no matter what they're told, so we should do what we
can to be robust against those violations.
