This is a helpful contribution.  Thank you!

 - Yescrypt seems to produce different hash for 32bytes length than for other requested lengths
   if it is intended

Yes, and yes.  256-bit (32 bytes) is a special case usable for
yescrypt's builtin support for "server relief".  For other output
lengths, that functionality is not applicable, so the corresponding
post-processing is bypassed.  For uses of yescrypt that don't care about
"server relief" (which most of them won't), this should not matter.

(yescrypt-lite will probably only support 32 byte output, so will invoke
those code paths unconditionally.)

(and not my mistake) then probably PHS() should fail for other req. output

Why?  The PHC call for submissions doesn't say anywhere that PHS()
output for a shorter length should be a prefix of its output for a
longer length.  In other words, the requested output length might or
might not affect any/all output bits.

In fact, now that you bring this up, I think a slight improvement might
be to always have the requested output length affect all of the output
bits, even if just to avoid any confusion of this sort ("hey, there's a
special case here").

To summarize, I think yescrypt's behavior is allowable per PHC terms,
for all output lengths that it agrees to produce.  Not just for 32.
