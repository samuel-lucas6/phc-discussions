Hi Folks,

first of all congratulation to the Argon Team. Alex and Dimitry did a
great job.

I think PHC was very successful since it  has pushed the boundaries of
password hashing and created some of the innovations that hopefully make
the vast majority of adversaries quite unhappy. :-)
 
Last but not least, special thanks to all PHC contributors and the panel
of experts, especial to Jean-Philippe.

Best regards,
Christian

We have selected *Argon2* as a basis for the final PHC winner. We will
work with the designers to determine the final version, and in
particular what tweaks will be made. This discussion will be carried
out on the public PHC mailing list (discussions@...sword-hashing.net
<mailto:discussions@...sword-hashing.net>), and everyone can contribute.

We will also endorse those four algorithms for scenarios in which
their unique capabilities are essential, although the Argon2-based
winner will be our main recommendation. Like for Argon2, the current
versions are not the final versions: their designers are permitted and
encouraged to submit improvements to their design, and the panel may
ask for specific changes.
