okay, maybe i'm too bitchy, so this is the last time i'm not going to
complain about this, and then i let people in charge to deal with such
things.

here are argon strengths as of now:

Tradeoff-resilient (50-70 computational penalty for using 1/2 of
memory)

what does that mean? 50-70 what?

Simple architecture

simple compared to what? certainly not simple compared to pbkdf2, or
compared to catena.

Fast with AES-NI (five-round AES)

what does that mean? why do we care how fast it is if we plan to run
it for 100ms anyway? what is "with" here? aes-ni is a prerequisite of
fastness? or cause? what is the point?

if the strengths section will continue to contain such vague and adhoc
claims, its usability will not be very high.
