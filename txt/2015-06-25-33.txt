Subject: Re: [PHC] Why protect against side channel attacks

one more point

in your scenario, client gets h(pwd, salt)

if side channel can reveal the data entirely, i steal this value.

then i initiate login attempt, i send password "crap", get back a
wrong h("crap", salt), then i just ignore this, and stretch the
recovered h(pwd, salt) instead. boom, i'm logged in, without even
knowing the correct password.

I'm just feeling that some of these arguments against cache-dependent candidates

i'm not aware of more than one argument: possible leakage
