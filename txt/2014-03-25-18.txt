Given a database that requires n shares to start validating passwords, what stops an attacker from creating n - 1 accounts with passwords under his control?--

The TLDR version of the scheme is as follows:
Today password databases store: "username:salt: securehash(salt, password)"
  An attacker can crack passwords individually by guessing the password and
computing the salted secure hash.
PolyPassHash stores: "username:salt:sharenumber: (share(sharenumber) XOR
securehash(salt, password))"   So a correct password allows the server to
obtain a share in a Shamir Secret store.   The only way to know if the
share is valid (and the password is correct) is to have a threshold of
shares.   Since a valid server gets many correct login attempts, it can
trivially do this.   The attacker needs to simultaneously guess many
accounts which increases the needed time exponentially.
