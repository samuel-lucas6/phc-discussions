Both are ok.

Copyright is one thing, and license another. Some picky lawyers insist on
having an explicit copyright statement, even if the license actually waives
any right that the copyright holder could claim. Otherwise they won't allow
usage of the code.

Since CC0 is a public domain dedication, “copyright (c)” in Intellectual
Property statement is rather confusing. You place something by disclaiming
copyright  on it, so this better be changed to the wording from CC0 FAQ (
https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ), e.g.:
>
- Argon2 code is copyright (c) 2015 Daniel Dinu and Dmitry Khovratovich
- Argon2 code written in 2015 by Daniel Dinu and Dmitry Khovratovich
