I think separating the Generate and Verify into formally distinct algorithms is a nice idea, and it's consistent with the way (some) people define MACs. It also allows for types of randomized hashing that wouldn't be possible using a single algorithm.

It still depends on the work factor, the resources of the attacker, and most of all the strength of the user-chosen password.
 
Even if the administrator’s chosen parameters were extremely conservative, the exposure of the hashes could constitute a data breach which requires disclosure, notification of users, etc.
 
+1 on the ‘define separate functions for generation and validation’ plan. But it does seem like that could be done mostly independently of the design of the hash function itself.
