Subject: Re: [PHC] Argon optimized implementation

I'm seeing only slightly slower results on my Ivy Bridge machine.  I
get 9.31 cpb for 64MB, 4 threads, 18.4 cpb with 1.  13.28 cpb for
1GiB, 4 threads, 24.79 cpb with 1 thread.  I'm not sure what the
difference is.  I would expect very similar cpb between Sandy Bridge
and Ivy Bridge.  It could be memory speed.  Maybe more full output
would help:

Memory allocated: 1024 MBytes, 1 threads
Argon:  24.79 cpb 24786.66 Mcycles 7.6244 seconds

I integrated this into my PHC test bench, so any memory/speed reported
will be the optimized version.
