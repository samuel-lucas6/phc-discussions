Sorry about this dumb post... I just got back from a Friday evening
social event, and have had about a bottle of wine.  I can't verify any
of the math above, and could not possibly have anything clever to say.

However, I still have gut reactions.  My dumb thought at the moment is
that I prefer pwxform to yescript.  Pwxform can mean Parallel Wide
Transform, but most of us will just say "password transform" in our
heads.  Yescript in my head is pronounced "Yes-script".  I don't know
why, but I prefer "password transform".
