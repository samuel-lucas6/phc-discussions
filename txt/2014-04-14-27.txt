Anyway, I think that if you want to be useful and feel like you could
write entries into the Wiki, then by all means go for it. Especially if
you want to fill out empty entries. A Wiki works on the assumption that
most writers are honest and well-meaning, and that some surveillance
(e.g. by the PHC Panel people) is sufficient to maintain order. If other
people are not happy with your edits, then they can fix them in any way
as they see fit. It _may_ be that this degenerates into local edit wars,
which would then warrant some mighty smiting from the Panel, but I am an
Optimist and I believe that we should give cooperation a chance.

I went ahead and filled out strength bullets for TwoCats (without the link
to the adorable cats).  Please edit them as needed, as my skills here are
terrible.  I figure I'll just butcher my own page :-)
