Yep.  This is all single threaded, and the comparison is to the
default Script package in Arch Linux on my son's MineCraft server (my
"development" machine).  Check out the waywardgeek branch of Catena:

https://github.com/cforler/catena/tree/waywardgeek

Christian was kind enough to let me have commit rights, but I have a
habit of breaking code, so I really have to have my own sandbox.  I
created the waywardgeek branch and have had a great time hacking it.

I replaced the hashing with the same multiply bound hash in NoelKDF,
and also changed H_LEN to 4096.  That's all it took to speed it up
dramatically.  You can checkout catena from:

 https://github.com/cforler/catena

These results should be easily reproducible.

Oh, I guess you meant Catena with "the NoelKDF multiply hash", not one
of Christian's versions.  Then this could be so, for some thread count
to memory bandwidth ratios.
