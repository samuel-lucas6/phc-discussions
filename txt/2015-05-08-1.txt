Hi everyone,

Thanks Alexander for forwarding the questions to the discussion list.

I believe this is correct. The candidates that are based on well-analyzed
primitives or the candidates that provide flexibility of selecting the
underlying primitive have a clear advantage for standardization. NIST would
probably want to approve a mode-like construction rather than a whole new
primitive. Approving a winner based on SHA-2 or SHA-3 will be 'faster' too.

Similarly, is NIST any more likely to standardize an eventual PHC winner
that is based on an established primitive such as BLAKE2 than on custom
crypto such as what we see in POMELO?

This is correct too. Although I like Pomelo, it needs more third-party
analysis. I donâ€™t think it is ready for standardization.

Finally, is it a valid argument for NIST that with proper entropy
bypasses from {password, salt} to PHS() output via an established crypto
primitive, the bulk of the processing may be considered non-crypto and
thus any custom non-crypto like this (e.g., yescrypt's pwxform) isn't a
barrier to standardization?


This can be a valid argument, I don't have a strong opinion on this. I
think simplicity of the non-crypto part is important here.
