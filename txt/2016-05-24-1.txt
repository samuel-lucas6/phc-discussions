Compare the two statements:

    Don't encrypt passwords, hash them. But not with a general-purpose
cryptographic hash function; you need to use a hash function
specifically designed to perform the slow, salted hashing of a password.
This means don't use something like AES or SHA256, but do use Argon2i.

    Don't encrypt or hash passwords, phash them. For example: Argon2i.

I find myself repeating the same footnotes every time I try to correct
an article or press release about "we encrypt our users' passwords". My
meta-argument is that using the same verb to mean several different
actions is ambiguous and causes confusion for neophytes and opting for a
different verb for every context avoids that problem.


This is a false dichotomy:

    Don't roll your own password storage; use a secure password hash, 
such as Argon2i.

The need for it might not seem widespread, but I'm reasonably sure that
adopting this approach will lead to better user understanding (i.e. not
calling literally everything you can do in cryptography "encryption").

Such a term is only needed because you're trying to fit this into a 
pattern that puts you in a linguistic straitjacket. By reframing the 
problem - and the problem is not encryption, or hashing, it's that people 
aren't using Best Practices - the need falls away.
