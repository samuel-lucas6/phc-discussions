Dear Donghoon,

As I understand, you are claiming that we 1) changed the selection criteria from the original ones 2) made them
inherently subjective and unjustifiable.

The criteria you focus on are:

 - Elegance
 - Originality and inovation

Regarding elegance, I don't see this as a changed criteria, but as a rewording of the original criteria. From the call,
under the 'Simplicity' bullet point:

 - Overall clarity of the scheme (design symmetries, modularity, etc.).
 - Ease of implementation (coding, testing, debugging, integration).
 - Use of other primitives or constructions internally (the fewer, the better).

I see elegance as the first of these: a more elegant design is one that is more symmetric and easier to understand. I
don't see this as any less subjective than the original call, and to my knowledge there were no major complaints about
the original criteria.

A second quote from the call: "Submitters are encouraged to propose innovative constructions and methods for protecting
passwords against attackers ...". It seems clear to me that the original intention of the call was to encourage
innovation in the submissions received, and what other way to reward innovation other than to move more innovative
submissions to the next stages of the competition?

You also claim that, unlike other competitions like AES and SHA-3, the employed criteria not only changed, but also were
inherently prone to favoritism and biases. I am obviously too young to have been present during the AES process, but I
remember NIST also changing criteria during the SHA-3 process. NIST:

 - Added new criteria, "complementing SHA-2", "a very clean and elegant design", the main justifications for Keccak's
selection;
 - Ignored its own criterion that the performance of SHA-3 on the reference platform had to be at least as good as SHA-2.

This is not to try and put NIST or SHA-3 in a negative light. What NIST knew when the call was written was not what NIST
knew when the process about about to finish; certain aspects changed in relevance midway, and NIST adjusted their
priorities and criteria as they saw fit.

Usual disclaimer: these are my opinions and perspectives and do not necessarily reflect the entire panel's.

Best regards,
Samuel Neves

Unlike the criteria in art or literature, the criteria of standards or

Now, a question arises, "given an algorithm, how can we measure the
elegance of design and originality and innovation of the algorithm in
scientific ways?"

As far as I know, there were (or are) no such criteria in cases of AES,
SHA-3, Caesar competitions, because such criteria are not scientifically
measurable! I believe that they can be only measurable by a biased
favoritism!

In the link (https://password-hashing.net/index.html), it is written, "To
identify new password hashing schemes suitable for widespread adoption, the
PHC follows the model of focused cryptographic competitions such as AES,
eSTREAM, or SHA-3 (see the Cryptographic competitions
<http://competitions.cr.yp.to/website)." However, I wonder whether the
PHC follows the model of focused cryptographic competitions or not.
