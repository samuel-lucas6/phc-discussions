Just came across something interesting about the newly-opened Broadcom GPU:

The vector register file is a block of registers 64 bytes across by 64 down which can be accessed horizontally (H) or vertically (V), and in units of 16 bytes (H8), 16 shorts (H16 or HX), or 16 32-bit words (H32).
Each processor has an accumulator that can be cleared (CLRA) or used (ACC).
This code is basically equivalent to the following C code:
[...]
This is code for the vector processor. This is not the same as the GPU cores which use a different architecture and instruction set (based around floating point calculations).

Seems like it would be good for 2D rotates and transitions to-from bitslices as well.

Is this a feature of other GPUs?
