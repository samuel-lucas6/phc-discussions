Of course, one can simply use an HMAC construction with any normal password
hashing function. If you have that in a dedicated hardware chip then you
may gain security, otherwise one should assume that any attack capable of
getting the hashed-password database is capable of getting any other secret
data, like private keys. Some of the submissions explicitly support keyed
password hashing, and with others any secure HMAC scheme should work. Using
a strong password hashing scheme with a key protects weak passwords, and
protects strong passwords even if the key is somehow leaked.

Even with a hardware chip one must be careful, as there might be a way for
the chip to leak the key. They're also not practical for systems using
virtualized hosting, and potentially insecure if an attacker can access the
hardware chip (such as in a server at a colocation facility.) It's safer to
assume everything that gets connected to the internet will be leaked and
design systems to keep passwords secret with that assumption.

But a strong way to protect passwords is to use MAC (much more secure than
using hash if the MAC operation is done in a separate hardware chip).  I
have talked about the advantage of using MAC to protect password web
authentication in my first post in the PHC discussion forum.  My idea is
similar to that of Phillip Hallam-Baker, except that I think a salt is
still useful even when MAC is used.

If MAC is used, even the weak passwords can be well protected (i.e., they
cannot be recovered directly from the password file).
