 Hi Steve,

 Thanks for your interest in our design and especially the source code.

 The pkhash_slow() was modified from one piece of old code, and it was using
big endian.
 I was in a hurry to complete the C ref code to be submitted to the
competition.
 That's the reason why it seems a little weird.

 We chose little endian to be compatible with Keccak and other minor issues.
 It is perfectly fine if you can implement the pkhash in little endian.

 Best,
 Bo

      I think there is an issue with endian in Catfish. E verywhere in
   catfish() it is little
   endian until it gets  passed into pkhash_slow() then it thinks it's big
endian and
   "in" is  "reverse for little-endian". Then is used as little endian.
Although this
   doesn't really matter since the input  is  from keccak. It just seems
weird.
 
I guess I'm either confused or being confusing, are you suppose to read the
output
of  keccak as little or big endian .
