Yes I (and others, like you KrisztiÃ¡n) have understood the technical
mechanics of how the attack would work for a while.  But I hadn't thought
through the whole scenario that I described in my email, and the part that
was new to me was that there isn't a good way to recover from this type of
attack...

To recover from a cache-timing attack where the attacker has the salt and
usernames, you can simply require users to reset passwords, just like we do
normally.  This gives you a new password/salt database, which should be
better protected in the future.

I am confused why a company would more easily learn of a password database
leak than a cache timing attack combined with leaking the salt database.
The usual signal a company notices first is a ton of complaints from users
with PWNed accounts.
