On Tue, Jan 14, 2014 at 2:28 PM, Bill Cox Out of curiosity, have you tried MultHash(hash, v[addr], prevV, v[addr
- C]) where C is something like L2 cache size?  It might help to have
even more taps.

That's funny because my previous hash function was exactly that,
though C was 1.  It did help, and was the version that "passed" the
DieHarder tests.  I'd be curious to understand your feeling for why
that would work better.  I discovered it through trial and error.

I guess Andy suggested this as an easy way to make some use of L2 cache
for defense, not as a way to improve randomness.
