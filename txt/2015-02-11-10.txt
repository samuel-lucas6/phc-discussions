We want panel members to feel free to give their opinions about
submissions relative merits and defects. Private, close discussions
are more appropriate for this than public discussions. One of the
reasons is that there'll always be individuals who will feel
personally offended by criticism of rejection of their proposal, and
as initiator of the project, I didn't wanted to expose panel members
to resentment of submitters.

I can understand the frustration of those whose submission was
rejected, especially if it required a significant amount of work/time.
When I learnt that Keccak was selected as SHA-3 rather than my
submission BLAKE, for a moment I hated NIST and felt that it was
unfair. Even when NIST gave their rationale I wasn't convinced and
wished I had the full recordings of NIST's deliberations, but that was
just for a moment.
