It's on topic for this list, but off topic for this thread.  You could
have asked the same question in a correct thread, such as the one you
had started for SkinnyCat. ;-)

Yes, I saw there was "TwoCats submission, which contains the SkinnyCat
sub-project as well", but I did not look at it.  I expect that someone
else on the PHC panel (perhaps JP) will respond to you about it.

Great, thanks.  Back on topic, my #1 request for PufferFish would be
having a 4KiB-ish block size with a user-defined repeat count, after
which it would be mixed with another 4KiB block.  This could L1-cache
compute-time harden the algorithm while being effective against GPUs,
couldn't it?  With a low repeat count, it could hash a lot of external
DRAM.  I like the simplicity, but busting out of L1 cache seems
problematic.
