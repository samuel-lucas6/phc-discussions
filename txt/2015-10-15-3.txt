Our program committee
(https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/passwords2015/people.html) are in their
final stages of reviewing a record high number of submitted papers, and
we also have a very good selection of tutorials (standard talks) lined up.

Our opening keynote is Chris Wysopal from Veracode, also known as Weld
Pond of the famous L0pht, and 1 of the authors of L0phtCrack. This will
be the story of L0phtCrack that unfortunately got cancelled in Las Vegas
this year.

More information on our program to appear very soon.
