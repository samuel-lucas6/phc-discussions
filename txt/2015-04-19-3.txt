Dmitry,

In order to get the numbers for other values of t, you just change the
constant 1.33 in main() to the number of passes.

This worked fine for the change to 4.0/3.0, but when I put 5.0/3.0, I
get an extra line of output:

Average Penalty for fraction 1 (100 close values): 1.33  Latency: 1.33 Read: 1.33

Since this line shows penalties of 1.33 rather than 1.00, I am concerned
that other reported penalties might be off as well.

Perhaps something else needs to be changed?

Can you explain the WIDTH_TEST / (3 * q) on this line? -

                        tradeoffs.push_back(TradeoffFunc(q, WIDTH_TEST / (3 * q),passes));

It corresponds to "unsigned top_size", and I don't see why e.g. for q=2
it should be WIDTH_TEST/6.

Thanks,

Alexander
