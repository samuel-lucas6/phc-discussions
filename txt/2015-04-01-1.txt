Note I believe there might be a problem with some of it: battcrypt on 5x and
POMELO on 3x and 5x. Since those algorithms don't have t_costs for those and I
think they are run at lower settings.

But ignoring that these are the best benchmarks I've seen since they're
normalized for rounds across memory and time vs memory (instead of having t_cost
or m_cost as an axis).
