PasswordsCon asks for submissions on topics for the Passwords track at
BsidesLV, at the Tuscany Suites on August 4th & 5th, 2015.

This year we will be fully aligned with BSidesLV in terms of talk
lengths, breaks & lunch, in order to give you the very best opportunity
to select from the full 2 days of high quality talks.

In addition to the usual topics, this year we are particularly
interested in seeing presentations about (in no particular order):

Comparison of, and “best practice” advice on password reset options
Cracking, bypassing or disabling 2-factor authentication
Broken hashing algorithms
Optimizations for well-known hashing algorithms
Cracking lesser-known / obscure hashing algorithms
New password cracking techniques
Non-Latin-charset passwords and passphrase analysis
Grammar-based passphrase generators
Enterprise password management solutions
Adaptive online rate-limiting for logins & password resets
Visual cryptography passwords
Keystroke dynamics
Fingerprint and other biometric spoofing
OSINT for targeted password attacks against accounts & services

Timeline
We will do two rounds of speaker selections, with time to adjust and
update topic & contents along the way if needed. Not sure about your
speaking capability or contents for a talk? Drop us an e-mail, and lets
see if we can help you out. (We’ve done it before, and we’ll do it again
!)

March 23 — CFP published (finally!)
April 15 — Round 1 Selections
TBA — Round 2 Selections

Submissions
Please use our submission form available at
https://passwordscon.org/vegas/cfp/ to submit your proposal by email.

- ------------------------------

Passwords is the first and only conference of its kind, where leading
researchers, password crackers, and experts in password security from
around the globe gather in order to better understand the challenges
surrounding digital authentication, and how to adequately address
them. While large mainstream conferences tend to focus on current hot
topics in the information security industry, Passwords events explore
fringe conversations on everything from analysis and education to
creating, securing, cracking, and exploiting authentication solutions.
And unlike other events where the speaker is rushed in and out,
Passwords provides an intimate environment for participants to
directly engage speakers before, during, and after their presentations.

Passwords was launched in Bergen, Norway in 2010, motivated by
dissatisfaction with the robustness and usability of current
authentication solutions. Now in its sixth year, Passwords is held
twice a year on two continents, and Passwords15 Las Vegas marks the
8th global event.
