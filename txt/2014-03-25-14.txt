Well, why assume memory is necessarily compromised for (i)?   Evidence
shows this is usually not the case: (

https://isis.poly.edu/~jcappos/papers/tr-cse-2013-02.pdf).   [ Full
disclosure, the second study was done by a student of mine.  ]


 So, for i., your scheme is security equivalent to the scheme of storing a
simple master key in memory.  Personally, I see measures of storing a
secret key in memory as part of a defense-in-depth approach as I'm
certainly not going to place all my bets on an attacker not compromising
memory -- the password hashes, in my view, must themselves provide adequate
security even when that secret key is compromised.

Sure, but if memory is compromised with PolyPassHash, the attacker only
gets the salted secure hash of passwords.   So, in the worst case you end
up with security equivalent to the best case today.

Thanks for all of the feedback by the way.   I was hoping this submission
would be a bit of a curveball and generate some discussion / thought.
