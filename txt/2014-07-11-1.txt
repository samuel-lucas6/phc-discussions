Subject: Discuss the contest in the media?

FYI: There has been some mainstream media interest in PolyPasswordHasher
(or PolyPassHash, as we called it before).

If the work is covered would those in the community like to have the
contest overall mentioned?   I was planning to do so, but I wanted to be
sure that this would be welcome.

Thanks,
Justin
