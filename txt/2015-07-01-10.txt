Several of the PHC submissions (https://password-hashing.net/candidates.html  ) have solid descriptions of their security analysis. The pdfs for Argon, Cantena, and Lyra2 stand out in my memory.

You might also like the papers on the finalists submitted to the NIST SHA-3 competition. It was the SHA-3 competition that first got me really thinking about this type of cryptanalysis.

What is the basis for your claim that a randomized sequence of operations from the set you have chosen results in a irreducible function?
Unfortunately, I don't have the background to properly answer this formally. This is where I think someone else, if they were interested, could contribute. To me, this seems "obvious" and "plain" - but there is "seeing" that 1 + 1 = 2, and then there's Russell & Whitehead investing 300 pages to prove it.
