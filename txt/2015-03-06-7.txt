how exactly a private discussion promotes the lack of bikeshedding?
this attitude puzzles me. why do you think anybody will accept what
you say, just because you say so? this would be an appeal to
authority, except you don't even have the authority to appeal to.

Based on my experience, fewer people =less bikeshedding, but I might be wrong.
