SHA-glue-factory-candidate: The 224-bit one

has the useful property that you can fit two of its untruncated
outputs into the input of a single invocation of the hash. This is a
2x speedup for a straight forward hashtree that uses SHA-224 vs
SHA-256 in the most simple and direct way.

The side reduced versions have the useful property of just having a
different initialization and then you truncate the output, so all the
code can be shared.

So the the differences amount to 32bit vs 64bit and some constants.
