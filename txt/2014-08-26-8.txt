Hi there, I'm a PHC judge. I think I may have inadvertently altered
the whole course of password hashing discussion from "Just use
bcrypt" to "Whoa, there are more options" via an inflammatory blog
post. ;)

That said, J-P's rules for judges stipulate picking my favorite 5
winners and 5 losers. I have really loved Bill Cox's analysis on
things that are clear winners and think I have OK opinions on that,
but I am completely at a loss to pick clear losers.

I'm not sure if this really fits the rules, but I'd love to hear
people's thoughts on the worst of the PHC. Apologies to J-P if
asking for this sort of thing is rude.

Sorry, but public flogging of clear losers wont do anyone any good.
It might be fun, though :-)  Now, over a beer, I'd be happy to tell
you my thoughts...

Bill
