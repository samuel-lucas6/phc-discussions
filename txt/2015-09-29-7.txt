We did not test the implementation on all listed T(n,k), but for your
second question (for constant ratio n/(k+1)) I can definitely answer that
the speed is linear in n.

Looks awesome. Did you consider including the actual run-time in Table I?
I'm curious how the run-time varies with n for semi-constant T(n, k).
