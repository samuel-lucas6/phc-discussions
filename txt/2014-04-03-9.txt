I took the liberty of sanitizing things slightly:

        Remove various binary files
        Remove hidden files

The plan/policy for this repos is stated in the README file:

        Over time, commits will be made to make life easier for

        Such requests should be addressed to the PHC panel@ email

Let me know if I messed anything up and I'll fix it.
