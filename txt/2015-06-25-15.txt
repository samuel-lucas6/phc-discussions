How?  In most cases, salt never leaves the authentication servers and
associated storage.  The salt is hashed/shredded before unpredictable
addressing begins.

So the timing-attack recovers the hash of the salt just before the
data-dependent path.  That's, theoretically, reduced the difficulty of the
problem back to the constant-time portion of the PDF.  (it's not
particularly practicable and quite a remote possibility but many of the
topics discussed on this list have been of a similar nature)
