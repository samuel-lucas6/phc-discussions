Fixed the bug with Argon2_id, should work differently now.

This looks really good!  Whoever you guys have working on the code did a
first rate job.  It is clean and concise at the same time, while being
readable and reasonably commented.  I have not yet done an in-depth code
review, but from what I've seen so far, it's exactly what I was hoping
for.  With this level of quality, Argon2 deserves to win, IMO.

- The types Argon2_i, Argon2_d, etc, should be commented in the code.  Few
programmers will bother reading the documentation, so the code has to be
understandable on it's own.  There needs to be some comments to help the
programmer decide which to call.

no place in the reference code where Argon2_id is used.  The reason the
vectors are different is probably because the type is hashed into the
initial derived key, as it should be.

Overall, this seems like outstanding work.  Thanks to everyone in the
Argon2 team for delivering a first rate solution!
