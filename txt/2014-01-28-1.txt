The Catena code does it this way:

- swap 4 bytes little-endian to big-endian style - 4 cycles max, or 1
in parallel.
- swap each upper nibble with the lower nibble:
    x = ((x & F0F0F0F0) >4) | ((x & 0x0F0F0F0F) << 4)
- swap bit pairs...

you get the idea.

It's just a few cycles.  Once per memory block, and it's no problem.
