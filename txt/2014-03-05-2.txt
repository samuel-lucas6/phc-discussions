I am not happy about the complexity.  Clearly, when supporting classic
scrypt and more, complexity is higher than scrypt's.  Is this worth
keeping, or should we drop support for computing classic scrypt hashes
in order to let us simplify things somewhat?

I'm not convinced that this is very useful.  I don't think that there
are all that many scrypt users out there, any most would probably be
happy just using an scrypt library and a PHC-winner library.
Litecoin, for example, will never upgrade :)

There's another benefit to dropping compatibility: it will discourage
people from using scrypt-compatible mode in new applications.
