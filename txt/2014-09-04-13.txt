This is a much stronger attack than the one on bcrypt.  How fast
can a CPU do a large multiply like this?

This attack will spend far less power per multiply.  However in
reality this attack will be limited by how quickly power can be
sucked out of the ASIC.  I would be tempted to consider a booth
multiplier and dynamic logic to lower power and size. Regardless,
it will still produce one multiply result per clock. It should be
built in a low power process so it will not run as fast as your
CPU.   The better the geometry the better the power.


I need to do a proper analysis to finish this comparison.  I find this
*very* interesting, so I'm doing it right now... until my boss gets
pissed.  It might take most of the day.
