Great.  Now, a way battcrypt might win over Pufferfish anyway is if we
determine that it performs better even when both are compiled to native
code (defensive).  This will take some testing, for both defense and
attack.  Are you doing this sort of testing? :-)


I included JTR patches for both the reference version and the optimized
version in my submission, and plan to write patches for some of the
other candidates as well. I was hoping we could reach out to the
community (john-users mailing list?) for help with this, as I really
don't want to implement all 22 by myself.
