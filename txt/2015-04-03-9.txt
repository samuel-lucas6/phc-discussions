Here's another relevant detail I recalled:

Pentium 4 (some or all of them? not sure) had double-pumped ALU, where
it could perform ADDs at double the clock rate (so up to 7.6 GHz, at
stock clocks).

Apparently, this could only execute two dependent ADDs in a cycle if
they are 16-bit each.  To me, this indicates that an ASIC would probably
be able to do similar for 32-bit if it wanted to.

So I think this confirms 8x-ish difference in latency between fastest
ADD and MUL.
