The math does not carry over to elliptic curves (or, at least, I did not
find a way to), unless you do something like generating a curve of order
n where n = pq with p and q unknown (in which case you gained nothing).

Class groups in imaginary quadratic number fields can give you a group
where the counting the order is presumed hard.

Sort of gone far afield for the list, sorry about that.

In any case, for some applications the potential of a trapdoor is
fine. ... e.g. if the trapdoor is per service and this system is just
used to authenticate to the service, I see no great concern.

When talking about parameters to be shared by the general public, I am
dubious that any amount of ritual is really sufficient:  Especially
since a good cryptosystem must be able to strongly reject conspiracy
theories that attackers could use to social engineer users out of
using strong cryptographic tools in the first place.
