For the record, similar ideas have been floated before.

So, lets say we can associate a given password with a scalar password 
complexity measure in the interval [0,1] with an as yet to be defined 
distribution.

here is my objection, above the obvious leak issue. calculating password strength is difficult. it will be a damn complex

What is the entropy of 'Pa$$word1'?

Or a password for which the hash has been exposed in a data breach and possibly cracked?

'Complexity' might be something that an individual site could define on it's own. But making a standard definition of 'strength' or 'password entropy' seems basically impossible.
