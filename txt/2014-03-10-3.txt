Also, I've been seriously considering using 32-bit lanes.  (This has
some pros and cons.  Among the pros is better compatibility with Salsa20,
where it'd let us ignore SIMD shuffling of 32-bit words.  escrypt
currently has some extra complexity because of this shuffling, yet
having its new sub-block mixing work on 64-bit lanes.)  I think that
with careful design and with use of the variable S-boxes, 32-bit lanes
would be OK in terms of issues described above, but they'd provide a
smaller safety margin.  (Luckily, we're not talking cryptographic
security here, but just attacks that would allow for computation of the
hash with somewhat less resources than intended.)

A naÃ¯ve question perhaps, but would 64-bit lanes incur an [unnecessary?] performance penalty for defender's implementations on 32-bit processors like ARM?  ...or could/should this be an adjustable parameter the site manager/sysadmin could set?
