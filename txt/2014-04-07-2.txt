Subject: Re: [PHC] Re: Yarn issues

I found two super minor errors.  First, PHS returns 0 on success, so I
changed the PHS function to return !yarn instead of yarn.  Second,
when mallocing main memory, you malloc(16 << m_cost), and I think it
should have been malloc(16ULL << m_cost).  I've made these changes
this way in the testing branch I'm working in.  Let me know if these
are the correct fixes.
