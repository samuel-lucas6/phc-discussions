The reason is that collision/preimage-resistance/PRF properties of the
primitive do not translate automatically to the mode of operation.

however in this case the mode of operation is the *same* as in the
underlying primitive. i don't use keccak. gambit *is* keccak. it
directly inherits security properties from the duplex construction.

in Gambit you did not encode both
password and salt lengths in the Absorb operation, you'd be in trouble even
though you use the sponge construction properly.

i defined the salt as fixed length. it is explained in the document,
as well as it is clear from the source code.
