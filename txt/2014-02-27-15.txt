I need a short name for cache-timing-attack resistant KDFs which do no

a mouthful.  I also use "KDFs which do password dependent addressing
from the start" about 20 times, and I discuss my "hybrid" version,
which like Scrypt, does the no-password-addressing thing in the first
loop, and does the password-dependent thing in the second.

Could we call the first type "predictable" KDFs, since they do only
predictable address lookups?  The second type could be "pseudorandom"
KDFs.  Are these good names?  I find it is hard for a group to discuss
ideas that have no concise name.

I feel like "predictable" without any other qualifications would
conflict too much with other uses

Definitely.

How about "blinded" and "unblinded" (or "nonblinded")?

I dislike these because they emphasize way of achieving something rather
than that end result itself, and in fact blinding might not always be
the way (and in Bill's example is not).

How about "cache timing safe" and "cache timing unsafe"?
