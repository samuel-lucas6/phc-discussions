Do you think we should produce a specification of MAXFORM on its own,

decision-making, with the concrete specification of MAXFORM on its own
only needed as part of a revision of the tweaked Argon2 specification.

The specific parametrization, with reference to pwxform, is good enough for me. I just wanted it to be spelled out. Thanks.
