Hi all,

we have updated the classification document (including analysis
regarding to (weak) garbage-collector attacks -- (W)GCA).

See: https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881

Among other minor changes, the update includes:
1) Argon2d and Argon2i (as two instantiations of the finalist Argon2)
2) yescrypt now provides (W)GCA resistance under certain requirements
   depending on the input parameter
3) tables now differentiate between finalist/non-finalists
4) added motivation for (W)GCA attacks in the introduction
5) BLAKE2b-1 is added as hash function for Catena
6) BlaMka is added as permutation for Lyra2 (in brackets, since it is
   not fully analyzed yet and thus, not recommended as default
   instantiation by the authors of Lyra2)

Comments are welcome.

Best regards,
Jakob
