Thanks, this is helpful. Is your code for escrypt public yet?

I had posted an older version of it in here, but the specific version I
benchmarked above is not yet public.

Also, I added a jtr patch for the reference implementation of pufferfish
to my github repository:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epixoip/pufferfish/master/jtr/pufferfish-ref.diff

I'm working on an optimized version now, and hopefully if time permits,
a GPU version.

Great.

Regarding your JtR patch, I noticed that you put my copyright notices on
your new files.  I think you're not using enough of my code to warrant
that.  I think you're using only the generic JtR format template, which
I previously stated (on john-users) as being too minor to be subject to
copyright.

Thanks!
