Subject: Re: [PHC] Best RNG for filling memory?

Sorry for this poorly informed post... I was unable to find a good source
package for benchmarking salsa20.  Do you know where I can get one that
simply spits out random numbers for a stream cipher that I can easily
benchmark?

MARC speeds up ARC4 by almost 2X, making it speed competitive with Blake2.
 Blake2 is based on ChaCha, which in turn is based on Salsa20.  From what
I've read so far, ChaCha claimed to be faster than Slasa20, and Blake
claimed to be based on ChaCha.  Why would Salsa20 be faster than Blake2?
