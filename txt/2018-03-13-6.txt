It seems to me the term "fractal compression" used in this thread might not
be the same thing as "fractal compression" discussed in this Wikipedia
article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_compression

The version of "fractal compression" discussed in the article is not
theoretical - it actually works and delivers superior quality at high
compression ratios, but at a significant computational expense.

Is this the concept you refer to with "fractal compression", or do you mean
a different kind?

What we do know is that the only way to find it, should it exist,
is bruteforcing a space vastly larger than the number of elementary
