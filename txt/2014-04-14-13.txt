Subject: Gambit code

I noticed you reference https://cryptocoding.net/index.php/Coding_rules in
your paper and tried to followed "use separate types for different types of
information". The reason you are suppose to do that is so you get a
compiler error. You are just typedef-ing them as uint8_t of some length.
That means they are all the same type with a fancy name on them. This is
why file gambit.cpp, line 19 compiles:
(uint8_t*)salt
instead of:
(salt*)salt

Just noticed a bug file gambit.cpp, line 115:
memset(mem, 0, sizeof(uint8_t)*cost_m);
should be:
memset(mem, 0, sizeof(uint64_t)*cost_m);


Huh I was going to say you missed the part on cryptocoding.net about bounds
checking, but there is no part about that.
