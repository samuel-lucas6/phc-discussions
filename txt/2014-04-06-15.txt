Subject: Candidates update + IMPORTANT note to submitters

M3lcrypt, POMELO, and Yarn have been update from v0 to v1. Changes are
tweaks in the code.

The revised submissions are available on
https://password-hashing.net/candidates.html

The specs document is renamed to the new version of the submission
even if no changes have been made to it.

IMPORTANT (to submitters): if you revise your submissions, please send
a revised package containing all the files of your submissions, rather
than individual files. This is much easier to process.
