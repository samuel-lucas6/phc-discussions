Hi all,

I run some simple tests with almost all PHC candidates
(plus Catena2 and RIG2 submitted here).

Maybe it could be useful, it is in fact it is kind of an independent extension
what Bill Cox sent here for reviews.

The long description with pictures here
  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/index.html

I updated test (according to discussion here) - see URL link above
 - added Gambit to fixed mcost/tcost tests
 - fixed Catena/Catena2 API hashlen bug
 - run Catena with lambda (tcost) 0
 - fixed some notes & graphs
 - Lyra2 crashes (segfault) if output hash length is longer that 191 bytes
   (probably just another parameter checking bug; missed this in previous version).

(If you have any ideas for possible automatic testing of 2nd round candidates please let me know.)

Thanks,
Milan
