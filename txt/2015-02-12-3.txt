Also, based on my understanding, the current status of the PHC seems to be
not in the final stage, but in the middle like Round 2 or Round 3 of SHA-3

elegance or other additional feature seems to be too early.

No, PHC is in the final stage.  Per the "provisional timeline (subject
to change)", the next step is to select the winners.

The wording I quoted above does (theoretically) give us the flexibility
to do things differently, but at this point I wouldn't expect us to.
(As I mentioned, we did discuss introducing a "round 2" before the final
round, and decided against doing so.)

I think it's going to be tough to produce all the analysis and optimized
implementations to make a fully informed selection of winners in "2015 Q2",
as the timeline says.  We may aim for Q2, but realistically I would
expect a delay to Q3.
