Do we have table with minimal tcost/mcost parameters supported?
(Some reference papers mention them explicitly but not all.)
Steve Thomas started one here:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2550

For Catena:
t_cost in [1,255]
m_cost in [1,63]

A t_cost of 1 doesn't provide any additional memory hardness, but
maybe suitable for some scenarios.
