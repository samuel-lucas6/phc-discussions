Thank you!  These charts are very easy for me to read.  It does look like
there's a grouping of the front-runners in memory hashing speed: Argon2d,
Lyra2, and Yescrypt, with POMELO close behind.  I had trouble seeing that
before.

I always see repeated colors, so this does not bother me at all :-)

The other thing is that we're still missing what I feel is the most
important charge for your use case: full disk encryption.  There is
simply no reaon not to use the multi-core capability of the machine.
Most entries do not have a parallelism parameter, but it is an
absolutely critical feature for FDE.

I see.  It does seem odd to ask the testing volunteer to create his own
interface to the candidates.

I think there are just 3 candidates now supporting multiple threads.  It is
surprisingly hard to guestimate parallel thread performance from parallel
process performance.  The reasons remain mysterious to me, but the short
version is that each thread seems to want sole access to it's own page.
Mixing nearby read/writes between threads thrashes something, maybe the
translation lookaside buffer?

I guess I'd like guidance from the PHC panel on this issue, if they want to
see multi-threaded performance.  It seems like an important attribute to
me, and there's no knob in the PHS interface.
