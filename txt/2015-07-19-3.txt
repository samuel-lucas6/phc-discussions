Honestly, the main culprit is the lawyers.  They like making as much money
as possible, and software patents in the US has resulted in many billions
for them.  The Federal Circuit Appeals Court in DC is populated with the
worst kind of lawyers - the kind that honestly believe lawyers do more good
when they make more money.

If you look at their decisions, such as the recent decision that software
interfaces can be copyrighted, the only possible explanation for their
actions is to benefit lawyers.  Being lawyers themselves, they are blind to
this massive bias they have.  The Supreme Court has fixed a few of their
worst offenses, but the truth is that this appeals court needs to have
patent law stripped from their responsibilities.

Patent law in the US will remain insane so long as this court is in charge,
IMO.
