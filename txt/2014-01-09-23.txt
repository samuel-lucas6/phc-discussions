From a theoretical point of view, Catena wins so far.  Avoiding cache
timing attacks is desirable, and Catena shows how to do it.  I am
concerned that the authors recommend only 10-ish MB of memory, when
escrypt can hash 1GB in a second.  Protection in memory-hard KDFs is
proportional to memory used!  While I'm a fan of the algorithm, if
Catena were more speed competitive, I would consider it a stronger
candidate.

Do you really want to allocate 1GB of RAM on a tablet or smartphone to
perform the login process? A lot of those devices have less then
1GB of RAM. In general I'm not convinced that a significant amount of
useres/admins are not pleased with a login process that
allocates a huge amount of the systems RAM. On many host, such a
solution will virtually enforce swapping. Just saying. :-)


We designed Catena to run smoothly on (almost) any modern computer
without causing extra pain for regular users/admins.
