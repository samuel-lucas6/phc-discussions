I just might!  I could also enhance it to provide an outer t_cost-like loop
that repeats hashes without increasing garlic.

Honestly, I think a good common API might be one of the best things to come
out of the PHC.  Improved PHS's are awesome, but improving usability for
the user could be just as important.  If the PHC committee is interested in
exploring such an API, I'd love to be involved.
