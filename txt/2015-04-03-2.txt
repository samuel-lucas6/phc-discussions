The SHA-2 mess wasn't so good either, we've ended up with:

SHA-256: Standard replacement for the universal hash, SHA-1.

SHA-512: SHA-256 for people with 64-bit processors and PDU space to waste.

SHA-also-ran: The 384-bit one that (presumably) the NSA demanded for Suite B,
              but which has no other reason for existence.

SHA-glue-factory-candidate: The 224-bit one that was created because someone
              at NIST had a few too many at one of the RSA conference 
              hospitality suites and bet a co-worker that they could get any 
              old rubbish into the SHA family [0].

[0] Complete fiction, but it makes as much, or little, sense as any other
    explanation.
