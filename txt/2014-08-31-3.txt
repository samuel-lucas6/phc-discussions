Bill,

On bcrypt:

Yes.

without any memory accesses using an async SRAM,

You're the expert here.  I can only say that a round is doable in a
single clock cycle with memory accesses, as has been implemented in
FPGAs already.  The addresses may be computed at the beginning of this
cycle, or at the end of the previous cycle.  Yes, combining both
computation and memory lookups on the same cycle limits clock rate.
Some 2-cycle designs might be faster, if 2x more memory is available.

I finally got around to placing the slides from Katja Malvoni's latest
talks online:

http://www.openwall.com/presentations/Passwords14-Energy-Efficient-Cracking/

This also includes a link to our WOOT '14 paper.  1 cycle/round bcrypt
designs are mentioned on the slides and in the paper.

As we learned in July, another team worked on bcrypt cracking on
ZedBoard as well.  They have a 1 cycle/round design too.  Curiously,
Ralf Zimmermann from that other team is also co-author of AntCrypt, a
PHC candidate.  It's a small world.
