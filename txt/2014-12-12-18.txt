What on earth do you mean by "salt table"?

For each user, you know both salt and Hash(PW, salt), you don't know PW.

The reason for using a salt is that if you have
   X_1 = Hash(PW_1, salt_1),
   X_2 = Hash(PW_2, salt_2),
   ...,

and have to re-compute H(PW_candidate, s) for each salt_i. Which is why 
the salt_i need to be different.

If you had no salt, then
   X_1 = Hash(PW_1),
   X_2 = Hash(PW_2),
   ...,

then you could just check look up Hash(PW_candidate) in your X_i table.

Which means, the attack would get much cheaper. (Similarily, if you are 
using the same salt for several users ...)

So long
