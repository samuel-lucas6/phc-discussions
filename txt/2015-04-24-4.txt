Server relief, keyed hashing and client-independent updates are all
important features. The problem is that one can only have two of the
three at the same time. It maybe possible to get them to work
together, but this will result in a lot of different code branches
depending on the number of updates and so on.
Taking client-independent updates out of the equations seems reckless
in most scenarios. You would basically put an expiration date on the
password hashes.
In the end it probably depends on the scenario or if you see a reason
for keyed hashing at all.
For the Web case we are probably looking at Javascript for the client
side and I'm not sure if this wouldn't introduce sidechannels on the
client.

True enough.  I remain a fan of client-side memory-hard password hashing,
and server relief as Catena calls it.  Server-side, you are lucky to get
more than a few milliseconds or enough memory to bust out of cache.  I'll
take 200ms of client-side hashing any day, even if the client is a
smart-watch.

Here's a simple upgrade to password hashing that I wish every company would
support: If a password is in a specific long format that appears to be the
output of a hash function (20 hex digits?) then skip the password hashing
except for the last hash (as done with Catena's server relief), because the
client already did it for you.  That way, you can support legacy clients
that send the password without hashing, while reducing server load and
improving security for everyone else.
