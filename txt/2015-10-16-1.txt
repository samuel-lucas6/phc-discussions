Subject: Argon2 PHC release...

Working on a simpler code package, current version posted at
https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2

So far reorganized and cleaned up the whole structure, keeping C only and
not C++, ported a minor change to the blake2b().

With the Argon2 designers we'll improve the test suite and will make the
argon2 command-line interface more user-friendly.

Comments and pull requests welcome :-)
