If we would assume the salt to be secret, we should not call it a "salt".
To avoid confusion, it would then deserve to be called a "key".

I'm curious if there was any period of time since the inception of the salt
that it was considered "public".

For a security engineer, there is a huge gap between considering something 
"not public", and assuming something "secret".

But no, the salt is better considered as "sensitive" and treated in the same
respect as the password hash.

Agreed. But if the salt where "secret", one would have to generate it from 
some high-entropy random source -- as you would do for cryptographic keys.

I have seen plenty of implementations using low entropy sources to 
generate "random" salts. Thus, when knowing user i's salt, you have a 
decent chance to guess user (i+1)'s salt.

This appears to be OK ... except when the salt is *secret*.
