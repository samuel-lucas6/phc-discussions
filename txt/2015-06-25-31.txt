You could have the client send
the password and the server reply with hash(password, salt) which the client
then does stretching on.

i guess it would, but adds one more round of communication, and also
removes the benefit of not needing the password ever leave the client.

all this hassle just to be able to use something that should not be
used in the first place anyway.
