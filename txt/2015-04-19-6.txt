After the initialization, though, the row is always read in the same order, so no further latency penalties apply as the recomputation depth grows.

Why does this mean no further latency penalties?  The recomputation
algorithm is unlikely to encounter the same missing row again before the
row has to be thrown out of the algorithm's temporary storage.  And the
row's columns are still needed in reverse order of computation, so the
first-computed column, which has to be stored, is the last-needed one.
Am I missing something?

Thanks!
