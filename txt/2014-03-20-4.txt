One reason I think we see applications running without SSE/AVX2

I've read does not provide for a single binary that supports both - I
have to link either to the blake2-ref code or the blake2-sse code.  My
TwoCats code has inherited this limitation, since I used the Blake2
code as a roadmap for figuring out how SSE2 works.

libb2 [1] does have basic support for runtime CPU feature detection. In
general, though, this is annoying to support in a portable way due to
different ways to invoke cpuid between compilers, operating system
support (you may have an AVX-capable system but the OS may not save ymm
registers across context switches), and so on.
