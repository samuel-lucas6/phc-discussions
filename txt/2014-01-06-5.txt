Thanks Alex for the constructive feedback.

I guess we won't need a formal definition of tweak, it's rather a
I-know-it-when-I-see-it: it should be a modification of the submitted
algorithm rather than a radically new algorithms, such that the
modified algorithm should not differ too much from the original one.

In previous competitions (AES, eSTREAM, SHA-3), I did not feel that
there was a significant need for "knowledge resuse", however I
understand that the case of password hashing may be specific.

I agree that it may be sensible to decide on the competition structure
(whether and when to shortlist, tweak, etc.) based on the knowledge of
the submissions received.

This afternoon I'm presenting PHC at the Symmetric Crypto seminar in
Dagstuhl (http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=14021).
I'm planning to announce the new submission deadline (March 31).

No objections from me.

I think many (if not all) of us are going to learn a few things from
each other's submissions.  It is important to let us reuse this
knowledge in revised submissions, and this may require more than tweaks.

I am also unsure of what qualifies as a mere tweak and what does not,
and whether adding an extra password hashing scheme variation or extra
mode of operation (e.g., a scripting language friendly one to a
submission previously friendly to native code only) falls under "tweaks"
or not.  (Obviously, I am assuming that the test vectors will differ.
If they don't, it's a mere implementation change, which is not in any
way limited by PHC rules.)

The scripting language example is not an arbitrary one.  What I am
seeing so far is that all new designs being discussed so far focus on
native code only, so far.  Yet I think that given more time, having
received initial reviews/feedback, and having seen each other's
submissions, some of those same teams may come up with variations of
their schemes intended for scripting languages.  It just feels premature
to work on that yet.

The game does have to have rules, but not necessarily the exact rules
outlined in the provisional timeline so far.  If you feel that we need a
round where we'd shortlist a few finalists, then I think we potentially
need an extra round (before the shortlisting) for the knowledge reuse.

We might have a slightly better idea on whether the shortlisting round
is needed if we ask would-be submitters to announce their plans to
submit by/on the previously scheduled date of January 31 (so it won't be
a surprise to them that something is expected from them by then, and
it'd be a relief that less is expected and they have 2 more months for
the actual submissions).
