about catena, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/525

i was about to open a conversation on iacr, but i can't register for some reason.

on another forum, the concern came up that catena memory hardness might not hold on shared memory multi-cpu systems.

i have an idea how to alter the black pebble game so it would model such systems.

in the traditional game, one move is defined as 

1. place a pebble if prev nodes are pebbled
2. remove a pebble
3. move a pebble (combined 1 and 2)

in the parallel model, one move would be

1. place any number of pebbles if prev nodes are pebbled before the step
2. remove any number of pebbles
3. move any number of pebbles (combined 1 and 2)

basically it would allow doing multiple steps in parallel if they don't depend on each other.

maybe worth checking how catena performs in this model.

Sorry, for the long delay. But this work took a little longer than
 expected. Nevertheless, we came up with Catena, a new memory-hard
 password scrambler based on the bit reversal function. A detailed
 description of our scheme is available on eprint
 (http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/525).
 
 We hope you enjoy this work, and we look forward to fruitful
 discussions, comments, and criticism (on this mailing list).
 
 Kind regards,
 Christian
