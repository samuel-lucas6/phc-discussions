I run some simple tests with almost all PHC candidates

The long description with pictures here

- I tried to visualize real used memory (measured by rusage()) and
run time with variable mcost/tcost (and generate some fancy graphs:-)

at this point, we have

gambit     | N/A - cost/memory dependent

i can not make sense of it. gambit has independent time and memory
cost, with a limit. but you certainly can run m-fixed and t-fixed
tests. the t-fixed case is easy, m cost is m*8 bytes. the time is
interesting, it will be slightly dependent on m.

example test values:

m=1..1000000  t=200000
m=1000  t=200..200000

- I run variable input/output test to check if it influences run time (see graphs).

the graphs have weird outlying points. is this some artefact of the
measurement technique? i don't think that algorithms behave that
peculiarly. in case of gambit, you have a point at 250, which is way
outside the valid range.
