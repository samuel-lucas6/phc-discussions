You can let your IRC client connected and configure it so that it logs
all conversations of that channel. If you can't let a client running
on one of your machines, there exist services that can do it for you,
iirc.

On a similar note, can we get a bot /join'ed to #phc that will log
discussion somewhere? I don't habitually hang out there, but it would be
nice to have a log that I could grep for mentions of EARWORM.
