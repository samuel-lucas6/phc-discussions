It's not just about indexing by salt, though. You still have to maintain
a list of salts to hash each plaintext candidate with, and remove salts
from said list when a salt is eliminated. Regardless of how you do it,
it is the number of salts, not the number of hashes, that slows down a
cracking job. Unless you are working with very large lists on AMD GPUs,
but that's a whole nother can of worms.

   I believe there is no need for the defender to maintain an index of 
   used salts

We're talking about password cracking software, not defenders.


   In this way, the adversary has to deal with each salt||hash combo as
   unique, with no opportunity to exploit duplications.

We don't get an opportunity to exploit duplications, but we still get a
speedup by maintaing a separate salt table, even if all salts are
unique. You eliminate more salts faster by looping over the salts for
each word in a wordlist, as opposed to looping over the wordlist for
each hash.
