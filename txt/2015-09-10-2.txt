Subject: CynoPrime finds AM src.code flaws, AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Clickbait subject and perhaps way off-topic for this list, but the work
done by @CynoPrime in this case is impressive to me, and serves as a
very important reminder on who should, and who should not be allowed to
implement crypto & password storage into any systems.
