Subject: Re: Comments on Argon2 v1.2.1

Another bug (and a typo!):

Section 3.3 describes how to derive a block of indices for Argon2i by
running G² on a bunch of inputs including:

    • i is is the counter starting in each segment from 0

Typo: "is is" (and "tWe", on the next line.)

Bug: The reference implementation starts the counter from 1 instead of 0.
