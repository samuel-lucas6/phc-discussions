I agree with Dmitry that more accurate security claims would help
cryptanalysts to understand what qualifies as an attack. It will also
help the PHC panel assessing the relative value of the submissions.
Refine security claims will thus be regarded positively by the panel.

here is the link to the slides of the talk I have just given at
PasswordsCon'14. It investigates time-memory tradeoffs for PHC candidates
Catena, Lyra2, and Argon, and estimates the energy cost per password on an
optimal ASIC implementation with full or reduced memory.

Additional comment: It is a standard practice in the crypto community to
give explicit security claims for the recommended parameter sets so that
cryptanalysts could easily identify the primary targets. Many PHC candidates
do not follow this rule by not only missing these claims but also concealing
the recommended parameters. As a result, cryptanalysts like me spend
valuable time attacking wrong sets or spreading the attention over multiple
targets.

Remember: third-party cryptanalysis increases the confidence in your design,
not decreases it (unless it is badly broken). Analysis of a 5%-part of your
submission (one of 20 possible parameter sets) is little better than no
analysis at all. It is also worth mentioning that to make fair comparison of
candidates, benchmarks and performance discussion in general should cover
recommended parameter sets only.
