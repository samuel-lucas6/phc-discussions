So, yes, at least escrypt and Catena teams would like a chance to submit
revised and/or different versions (beyond mere "tweaks"), where
influence by other submissions (which we can't possibly see all of
before the round 1 submission deadline, whatever it is) might play a
major role.  For example, I might like some aspects of new Catena so
much that I'd want them in a major revision of escrypt (beyond tweaks),
yet not like the new Catena as much as to choose it over escrypt almost
as-is (with mere tweaks to Catena).

I just revised the eprint paper. Happy reading :-)

Furthermore, I just created a new github repo for the Catena reference
implementation (https://github.com/cforler/catena).

We appreciate any optimized implementation of Catena, or any other kind
of constructive contribution. Volunteers are welcome. :-)

Best regards,
Christian
