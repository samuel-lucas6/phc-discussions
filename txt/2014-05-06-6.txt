Subject: RE: [PHC] Hashing password while typing

Overlapping hashing and keystroke entries also doesn’t work well when a password is copy and pasted into the entry from a password safe via a clipboard.
 
This seems to have a limited use case when keystrokes are being entered to a local application (or a terminal session) and processed individually as received.  That’s not exactly the common case, especially in GUI settings and use of form fields.

Well, I did call it a "dumb" idea :-)  I get inflicted with them a lot.  I agree... it doesn't seem like there's much to be gained with such an approach.  I was hoping someone might see a way to get around the precomputed prefix problem.  I haven't found one.
