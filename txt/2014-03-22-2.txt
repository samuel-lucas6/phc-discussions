What does the  'Ability to transform an existing hash to a different
cost setting without knowledge of the password', mean exactly?

Simply put, it means the ability to take a password hash from the
database and upgrade it to a higher cost setting without knowing the
password. This way administrators can upgrade the security of an entire
database without hooking the login process to re-hash the password, or
forcing users to change their passwords.
