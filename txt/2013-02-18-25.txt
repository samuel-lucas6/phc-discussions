The ASCII/non-ASCII about desirable test vectors suggest that being
character set sensitive is permissible.

I don't think it suggests that at all.  The purpose of test vectors is
to check the correctness of implementations.  One plausible way to mess
up an otherwise-correct implementation is to mishandle inputs containing
non-ASCII characters. Therefore non-ASCII test vectors are desirable.

I would amend the recommendation by explicit calling for some test
vectors containing embedded null bytes.
