Subject: my pre (if) submit proposal


here is my attempt at password hashing. i wrote about it on the list,
quite some time ago. the proposal has been polished since, but the
core is the same. also better documented. comments welcome either here
or in the document, see later.

quick overview: it is a sponge construction. the idea of a sponge
based key stretching is presented by Keccak authors. my proposal is an
extension of that concept that uses large memory by continually
squeezing data and reabsorbing it later in a different pattern.
