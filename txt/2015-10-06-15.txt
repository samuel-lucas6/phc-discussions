Autoconf would just be for the build scripts of the reference code package.
The actual source code is independent of the build system and can be reused
as per the licence's terms.

Not me, but: would this mean the code would then not build at all
without autoconf?  If so, that's a drawback that we should try to avoid.
Not every project that might want to embed an Argon2 implementation will
be autoconf'ed (nor will want to be).

Just to give everyone an example of the above mentioned problem:

I'm sure the Crypto++ project will strongly oppose requiring anything
beyond standard libraries (including OpenMP) [1].
So if the code forces other libraries to use AutoConf, this code can't
be included in Crypto++ and we (= the Crypto++ team) have to code Argon2
from scratch which I think is highly undesirable for all parties.
