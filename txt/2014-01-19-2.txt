I'd say "secure tunnel" is orthogonal to "client-side hashing", as well
as to "better password hashing" in general.  Any of these are somewhat
nice to have even without the others, although of course a combination
of them is usually preferable.

I agree that my questions are borderline off-topic, but as an observer of the process I question the value of well protected passwords at rest if they can be siphoned off before they even get there.  Like so many problems in security, a balanced approach seems best.  

A good solution here is welcome but some quick reading suggested by Tony confirms my suspicions that there are arguably even weaker links.  Nevertheless, each link needs to be improved and the discussion here has been both interesting and enlightening.  Thank you all.
