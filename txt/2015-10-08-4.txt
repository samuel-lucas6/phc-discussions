Subject: Threads in Argon2

Argon2 now supports up to 2^24 threads.

It is also possible now to request more lanes (possible parallelism) than
threads (actual parallelism).

The improvements are valid both for C++11 and C99 implementations.

The specification has not updated yet, as test vectors are the same.
