It's awesome we're both reading and hacking catena.c.  Christian has
some awesome ideas, and it would be a shame to see his ideas lose out
just because no one wrote a competitive bit of code for him.  I am
still waiting for my free banana...

I want to point out that Catena is a joint work with Stefan and
Jakob. Credits should given to the Catena design team. :-)

Thanks Bill, you did a great job by implementing a high performance
version of Catena. Currently we have a serious internal discussion about
your work.

Furthermore, we are all terrible busy since we are also working on a
submission for the CAESAR competition
(http://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar-call.html). In addition, we have to
write some other research papers, give lectures and so on. this results
in a lack of
feedback. We do all appreciate your dedication to the PHC competition a
lot.


PS.: We run out ouf real world  bananas. :-(
But for starters, I can give you this virtual one. :-)

I really hope we will see each other at  some PHC related conference.
Then I will reward you with some drinks and bananas. :-)


Best regards,
Christian
