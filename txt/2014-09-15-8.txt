I guess I should of just posted code in my first message:
https://github.com/Sc00bz/break-schvrch

This takes about 3 minutes to run. With SSE or AVX it will be faster but this is
a nice PoC. Note that the generation only needs to be done once per m_cost and
once for each t_cost when m_cost is zero.
