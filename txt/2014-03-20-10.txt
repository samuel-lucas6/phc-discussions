 Bill don't try to learn SS*E*/AVX* from the blake2-ref code... besides being
 buggy.


So I finally got around to almost reporting the endian assumption bug
in one of the *_init_param functions when I found out I was looking at
the SSE  version. I started looking at the SSE then switch to the ref code.
I had blake2b.c, blake2b-ref.c, both blake2.h and few  other .h files open.
I was being stupid.

Sorry Samuel Neves I was wrong.
