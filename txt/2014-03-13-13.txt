A service I help run has had peak authentication rates of 1200/sec, so in the worst case that's 1.2TB of RAM. Maybe the servers are extremely RAM-limited, but they don't have 1.2TB each. :-)

I wish this were the problem, but it's actually worse than that: you
can't fill this much memory quickly enough.

We can't even fill 16 MB (the minimum specified in scrypt paper) quickly
enough to meet the request rate capacity stipulated for a deployment.

That's why the "ROM" for use cases like that.
