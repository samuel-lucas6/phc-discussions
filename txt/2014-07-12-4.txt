Subject: Re: [PHC] Discuss the contest in the media?

helpnet security (net-security.org), securityledger.com and arstechnica.com will be at #passwords14, Marsh & Greg from Microsoft does a talk on what Microsoft would like to see from PHC, and JP will introduce ALL the candidates in his presentation. Its a good start imho, getting PHC known around the world.

More info & schedule at passwordscon.org

I'd say that drawing attention to the fact that there is such a contest, and that it is still in progress (though closed to submissions), is a good idea. We'd like people to use the contest winners, since they're likely to be good password hashing functions.
