Subject: pre-hashed passwords?

(After reading this nice post about passwords including null bytes:
http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2015/03/security-issue-combining-bcrypt-with.html)

Has anyone already seen password hashes "pre-hashing" a password, to
handle length limitations? Things like

password_hash(hash('sha256', $password, true), PASSWORD_DEFAULT)

password_hash(hash_hmac('sha256', $password, $key, true), PASSWORD_DEFAULT)
