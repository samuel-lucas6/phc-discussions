I dislike this idea because not everybody is working in the same
order. For example, EARWORM's reference and optimized implementations
are already finished, and its spec nearly so, but the security and
efficiency discussion is not yet written. If the deadline remains at
Jan 31, the thoroughness of those sections is what will suffer. I
doubt that there is any reduced set of requirements that will make
everybody, or even most people, happy.
