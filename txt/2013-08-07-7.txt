I didn't have much trouble reading Trevor Perrin's Python, but I note that it didn't *actually* seem to be parallelizing over multiple threads. The Ruby looked like it would run in parallel, except that the normal interpreter doesn't do that. Go figure!

Out of the box, Python is single threaded.  To thread Python you will need to import "thread" (low level) or "threading" (higher level).  ...or for multiple processes, "multiprocessing".
