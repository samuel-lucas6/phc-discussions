On the other hand, taking Alexander's advice is how I managed to PO my
boss and fail to sleep for more than about 4 hours a night for three
months.  PufferFish is good.

If everyone did what Alexander is doing, there wouldn't be any point in
having a competition ;)

Seriously though, it's not that it's a bad idea, it's that I'm already
committed to this design. Provided how close the deadline is, and how
much work I still have left to do to prepare my submission, I don't
really have time to even begin to think about how I would implement such
a feature.

That said, if anyone wants to fork the current reference implementation
and play around with implementing this idea, and submit a pull request,
I just might appreciate it greatly.
