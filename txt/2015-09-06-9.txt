Hi, Samuel.  I have not thanked you yet for those links to the original
work on elliptic curves and Edward's paper.  Those were awesome, and took
me a couple weeks to get through.  I still do not understand the manifold
stuff in Edward's paper, but I understand most of it.

I am pretty sure TwoCats is the fastest entry in the competition for
single-thread hashing, which is refuted in this  paper.  It's not a matter
of which CPU or mode of measuring speed.  There might be some special case
where this is not true, but I have not found any.  Maybe they ran in debug
mode or some such thing, which is probable if they checked out my current
branch.  I check in a lot of errors like that.

Actually, EARWORM beat my hashing speed.  It was the fastest in the
competition.  That is an awesome algorithm.  I wish he'd entered a modified
version with stronger distributed-ROM defense.  With the AES-NI based
hashing, he would easily win the speed contest, though with the restriction
of requiring special instructions in the CPU.

Bill
