Sorry, I do agree that it doesn't hurt to have e.g. a secret that is e.g.

too much on the secret, and offline attacks become trivial if you have both
the secrets and the salts+digests.

We're not going to consider such schemes seriously.  The call for
submissions should be clear in this respect.  Isn't it clear now?

I didn't mean that it should be ignored,
