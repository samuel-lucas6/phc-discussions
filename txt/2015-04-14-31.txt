As to fixing this, maybe the rounds loop should go from 1 to PWXrounds
in the spec, whereas implementations may also make it from 0 to
PWXrounds-1 (or even use a "do ... while (--count)" loop, or an unrolled
loop).  

Because the index variable "i" is not used within the loop, 
I think the pseudocode would be clearer if it simply said, 
"Repeat PWXrounds times:".

The code is correct as-is, so there won't be a change to that

The pseudocode is present in the comments of the code.
