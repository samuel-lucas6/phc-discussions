I would amend the recommendation by explicit calling for some test

Note that some of the submissions will be intended for implementation
in scripting languages, whereas the C implementation of them will be to
fit the PHC terms (allow for uniform testing of all submissions, etc.),
as well as to ensure correctness of the scripts (e.g., I made a C
implementation of phpass "portable" hashes for that very reason).

Yes, PHS() is defined to accept inlen, but in many scripting languages
and in many other APIs NULs may be problematic anyway.

Should PHS() support embedded NULs even when the password hashing
scheme's primary implementation - one intended for actual use - does not
support embedded NULs?  Well, perhaps it should...
