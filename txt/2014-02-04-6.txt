Looking more closely, I see there is an issue if doing a
client-independent update, since the old hash is not run through
PBKDF2-SHA256 to initialize wordHash.  I haven't checked this hash
update code well enough.  The new hash may be too correlated with the
old hash in this case.  I probably need a call to PBKDF2 in the garlic
loop to cleanse any correlations between hashes.
