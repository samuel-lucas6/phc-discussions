Subject: Re: [PHC] MCS_PHS memory cost parameter

on
https://github.com/bsdphk/PHC/blob/master/MCS_PHS/code/mcs_psw/mcs_psw.cpp#L57
an array tmp[] of m_cost bytes is filled with predictable values, thus
it doesn't need to be stored.

if we look at the specs, on p3 and p4:
* steps 3 initializes a large array T_0, then
* steps 4 computes an iterative hash of T_0 to create a short T_1,
then hashes T_1, etc.

as I understand from the specs of MCS-SHA8 in
http://crypto.systema.ru/mcssha/MCSSHA-8%20(eng).pdf, the function
iterates over blocks of the messages, and the complete message doesn't
have to be kept in memory to be efficiently hashes.

AFAIU from the MCS_PHS specs, the memory cost parameter dCostLen is
ineffective:

Dear Jean and all other members of PHC.

I prepare my answer in attachment. I can't understand what's problem. I can
make some modifications of MCS_PHS, but, please, explain me, what is your
requirements or simply wishes.
