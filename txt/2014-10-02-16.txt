In that case, I'll claim that "proven" status for Makwa.

Seconded.  The Makwa algorithm is proven as secure as integer
factoring, with the only serious complaint being that the factors need
to be carefully scrubbed from existence if we are concerned about
attackers finding them.

Several other entries have also proven their basic security, like
Yescrypt, through "strongly secure" hashing of all inputs with a
strong existing cryptographic primitive, and a proof that significant
entropy is not lost.  If you like, I can go back through my reviews
and point out the entries that have secure basic cryptography, and
which ones need more expert review than I can provide, which are those
that invented new hashing primitives, and then rely on them for security.
