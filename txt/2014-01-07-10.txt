Hi again.

What I meant is that the discussion helped me to understand Lyra a little
better: seriously, I could not explicitly see the DAG in our own security
analysis until I analyzed Catena more carefully and understood its design.
Now that I see the DAG, it is much easier to understand its limitations
and possible improvements.

The algorithm won't change a lot, though, and I doubt it will be much
similar to Catena or NoelKDF: no offense, their designs are great and
worth copying, but I still need to cheer for my own design or for me the
competition will not be as fun ;)

Marcos.

Please feel free to borrow any idea I might have inspired, and even feel
free to copy/paste my code, which I'm making public domain.  I honestly
feel bad about incorporating such great ideas from Catena and escrypt.  I
hope I've offered some useful ideas, but there is clearly more great stuff
coming from those guys.  Experience in a field does make a difference.
