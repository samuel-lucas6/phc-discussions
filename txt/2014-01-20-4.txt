The server would have to store b along with the password for this

leaves a real replay opening, if the server happens to ask for the
same X again.

But would it be worth the extra complexity ?

A database leak would get you b. Knowing b gives you an early out.
Even if b is 5 bits that speeds up the attacker by 32 times. Also you
might be able to guess what b is by how long it takes the client to
calculate the hash.
