Hello,

The issue here is the hidden pebble: In the pebble game we need
temporary storage for the computed result.

i wonder if the hidden pebble can be modelled as simply as eliminating option 3, the moving?

we don't really want to fix the number of processors, becasue then we would have an entire class of problems to solve, one for all k. maybe we can handle that by this modified ruleset. what do you think?

however this assumes the 1 hidden pebble per move, there can be more.

For example, take a bipartite graph. Then your parallel game lets it
be done in one step, but this is only true if you have N processors.
What's needed is limiting the number of pebbles in each step to k,
where k is the number of processors.

Circuit complexity is probably what we really want to deal with.
