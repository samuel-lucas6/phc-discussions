That seems worth trying (actually, we need to find someone with better
implementation skills than ourselves: most of Lyra2's code tricks come
from Blake2b's original implementation...). Thanks!

We used this trick (replacing + with ^, * with &) in NORX (pg. 23 of https://norx.io/data/norx.pdf); it does noticeably
improve latency.
