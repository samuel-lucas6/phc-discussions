Dear Donghoon,

Dear Stefan,
Thank you so much for the reply.

You are welcome! :-)

I just explained in other two mails regarding how the 2nd round and 
final round candidates of SHA-3 were selected in scientific ways based 
on facts found in the SHA-3 zoo and eBASH, etc. 

I disagree, as I explained in my response to the other mail of yours.

So long

Stefan
