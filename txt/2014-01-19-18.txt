last time i explained that, you called me a dork and another adjective
i don't remember now. what happened? you have leveled up since? or
became a dork yourself?

Yes, I have been a dork.  Sorry about that.  I have in common with you
a tendency to color what I say with strong feelings, and that gets me
in trouble.

Assuming you can get forgive my past crude remarks, I would be
interested if we're actually both concerned about the same issue:
memory leaks as the main threat against memory hard KDFs, and I am
interested in your thoughts on Blakerypt style mitigation techniques,
and if such protection can be extended to client-side hashing.
