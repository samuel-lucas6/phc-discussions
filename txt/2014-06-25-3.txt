So while it could be a good idea in terms of bits mixing, I think it is
not good enough to implement with individual instructions (until a CPU
gets a single instruction like this, with same latency as MUL alone).

I wonder if it'd be feasible to piggyback on the push for GCM and use CLMUL 
and its (prospective?) siblings on other architectures.
