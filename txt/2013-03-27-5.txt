It still depends on the work factor, the resources of the attacker, and most of all the strength of the user-chosen password.

Even if the administrator’s chosen parameters were extremely conservative, the exposure of the hashes could constitute a data breach which requires disclosure, notification of users, etc.

+1 on the ‘define separate functions for generation and validation’ plan. But it does seem like that could be done mostly independently of the design of the hash function itself.

This isn't necessary: a non-constant time comparison at worst reveals the hash, which doesn't give an attacker
enough information to break a password anyway if we do our jobs right.
