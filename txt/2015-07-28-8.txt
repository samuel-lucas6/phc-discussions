Another cute Catena framework feature might be building hybrid memory
hashing algorithms by combining password-independent and password-dependent
algorithms.  For example, hash using Catena or Argon2i for 1/4 of the time,
followed by Argon2d or Yescrypt for 3/4 of the time.  This would retain
most of the memory*time off-line defense, while providing a significant
improvement against side-channel attacks over Argon2d or Yescrypt.  It's
not as good as a hybrid algorithm, but it's not bad.
