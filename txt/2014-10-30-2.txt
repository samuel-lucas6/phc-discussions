yescrypt does support server relief - only a tiny pre-final hash needs
to be transmitted to the server.  (Moreover, it also supports use in a
straightforward modification of SCRAM.)

The same is true for pufferfish as well, which is also marked as not
supporting server relief. The blowfishy part can be done client side and
transmitted to the server, and the server stores the final SHA512 hash.
I've been wanting to formally add a javascript implementation to the
reference implementation, but my javascript is weak.
