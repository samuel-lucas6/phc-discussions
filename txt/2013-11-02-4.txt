let me point out that the hacked system is a legacy system that is
scheduled to be rolled out.

if there is anything to learn from this story, it is that we don't
want legacy systems to be around. old crypto has to be rolled out as
soon as possible. we need to be flexible and up to date. even if it
costs us.
