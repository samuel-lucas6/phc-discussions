BTW, this card is similar to the GTX TITAN that we have in "super",
which Thomas has access to:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_700_series

The 780 Ti has a lower TDP of 250 W

Same for the GTX TITAN, and after the recent driver upgrade the
nvidia-smi command reports its current power usage (it says around 25 W
at idle now).

instead of the HD 7990's 375 W

HD 7990's actual peak power usage is commonly somewhere in the 450 W to
500 W range - and yes, this card can't cool itself then, relying on
chassis fans and such.  It is unclear whether Thomas' code gets it this
far or (more likely) not.  Unfortunately, a driver update broke Thomas'
code performance, so he'll probably run new benchmarks and we'll measure
the actual power usage delta (load vs. idle) - can do it via IPMI -
later.  BTW, there's yet another AMD driver update pending - sorry!
