OK, I added this warning.

Since this version isn't necessarily "the final PHC-winner-Argon2", I
think it's preferable that you add a statement/warning to this extent to
the start of README.  As it currently is, people coming to the GitHub
page might think it's the final Argon2, and they would be upset if you
have to break compatibility later.  As JP wrote:

Thanks! We're gonna review the changes done, and we'll discuss on how to
move from this version to the final PHC-winner-Argon2.

Unfortunately (for the original Argon2's security), this may be more of
an implementation difficulty than a fundamental limitation of GPUs.
We might give some non-trivial approaches a try, but this isn't going to
be as simple as programming with vector types in OpenCL (those vectors,
so to speak, get rotated 90 degrees against our desired placement).
