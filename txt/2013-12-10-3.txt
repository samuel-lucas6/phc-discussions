Subject: Re: [PHC] IETF draft

Basically,

output = hash( rsa_encrypt( hash( salt+password ), public_key ) )

It states:

  Preferably the algorithm should have no generally and cheaply available
  hardware implementation. Also, it should be a generally known and
  widely implemented algorithm. For example, RSA public key encryption
  could be used.

This is a strange claim; I thought research on high-speed RSA hardware
has been going for a long time, no?

There are already some discussions on the IETF lists, .e.g.,
