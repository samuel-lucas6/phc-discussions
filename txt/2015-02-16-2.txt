Subject: [PHC] PHC status report

I have a very candid question for Krisztián Pintér and Somitra Sanadhya:

Do you think there's a general process problem with the PHC, or do you
think specific candidates were descriminated against?

My personal opinion is I feel like you're alleging the former, when really
what you're trying to argue is the latter.

Can you please clarify the specificity of your complaints?

this is the actual information you based your decision on? i'm pretty
sure one of you put this document together in one afternoon. i see no
reason why would anyone hope to learn anything here after this. i can
only hope the crypto community knows better than trusting a false
sense of authority provided by an acronym (PHC), and chooses to ignore
this non-information. if not, you are welcome to choose your own
candidates as winners, and celebrate.
