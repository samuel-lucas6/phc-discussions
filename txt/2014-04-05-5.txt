While I don't have the time myself to do it this weekend, it might be
better actually looking at the PHS output and what's going on in the
reference implementation because you'd expect at least a wee bit of
non-zero results.  What you've got looks like a bug somewhere.

Also, although it's probably not what's causing your results here, I'm
fairly sure that the dieharder tests aren't great for short inputs.

If you want to demonstrate an algorithm isn't collision resistant, a sample
collision usually persuades people, e.g. x = f(a_1) = f(a_2).  Or at least
provide an argument of how much work would be required to generate a
collision.
