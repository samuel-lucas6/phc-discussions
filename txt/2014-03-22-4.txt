These are not hard requirements, they are simply critera that will be
evaluated in each candidate. You may choose not to support a particular
feature in your design.

Thanks Jeremi, but for the calculation of a password hash another
requirement is that we need sufficiently large memory and we
constantly use them throughout the calculation. Now if we try to
update the previous stored hash then next calculation will only depend
on the stored hash value and then how will it fulfil the memory
requirement criteria for transforming hash to different cost setting.

    What does the  'Ability to transform an existing hash to a different

    Simply put, it means the ability to take a password hash from the
    database and upgrade it to a higher cost setting without knowing the
    password. This way administrators can upgrade the security of an
    entire
    database without hooking the login process to re-hash the password, or
    forcing users to change their passwords.
