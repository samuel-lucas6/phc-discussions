the diehard, testu01, dieharder, etc test suites are not cryptographic
tools. failing these tests is a clear break, and at least calls for
another postprocessing step (together with an assessment of actual
entropy content of the raw output). however, passing such tests mean
exactly nothing in crypto context.

For reference with regard to how meaningless these tests are, a 32-bit
LCG with a trivial tempering function taken from MT applied to the
output can pass most if not all of dieharder. (I'd have to recheck to
confirm that it's all, but I seem to remember it being all when I was
developing that code.)
