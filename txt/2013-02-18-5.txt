Actually we're both wrong. There are 175 million users at the time

Do we know if the released unique hashes represented all the unique hashes of

My guess is that 13 million account hashes got compromised. I'm going off
RockYou's data (2.2 users/unique password). I thought 30.2 users/unique password
looked a little high.


(once you remove the first 8 characters of the hash because some
hashes had their first 8 characters zeroed out).

Did those turn out to be the easiest to break? There was speculation that
attackers had zeroed out the beginning of the ones they'd been able to break.

I heard that too, but I don't believe that is the case since there are 670,781
duplicates in the list when you remove the first 8 characters.

unsalted: 0.1 ms (100,000 / 10^9)
salted: between 4 hrs 52 min and 2 hrs 26 min (175,000,000 * 100,000 / 10^9
to 175,000,000 / 2 * 100,000 / 10^9)

So, at least in the absence of a meaningful work factor, we can conclude:

True, but salt prevents the use of rainbow tables. Which would help a lot in
recovering a few hashes.
