I would not worry about the IP on the PHS API.

FWIW, the PHS API consists of only one function prototype specified on
https://password-hashing.net/call.html

That prototype was agreed upon by a subset of the panel members,
including myself. As copyright holders, I think we will all agree to
license it to anyone under public domain-like terms (CC0, Unlicense,
etc.).

That said, I believe it is necessary to clarify intellectual property
terms on the PHC website. I will discuss this with qualified people,
and will add the relevant statements to the website. Hopefully next
week.

The original expression (not the part that is from another source) in all

the original part of your PHS contribution is already copyright by you.

Those BSD and GPL notices incorporated in files do not change their
copyright status, they simply prescribe the allowable use by offering an
automatic license that is available so long as the terms and conditions are
honored.  I don't know what you put in the headings of your files, but if
you want to be clear, it is important to be explicit about what the
automatic license is to be, if any.  And if you have made a derivative of
(parts of) other work, the licenses on those works must be honored by you.

What we're seeing here is a dispute among two commercial actors.  Oracle
certainly wants people to use their "API" (as clarified by the court
concerning what "API" is in the context of Java).  Oracle claims commercial
harm in the resultant "fork."  Apparently, the OpenJDK license was not
something Google was willing to honor.  We'll see how it goes when the
fair-use question is retried.

Thanks for the link. I read: The jury found that Google infringed Oracle's
copyrights in the 37 Java packages and a specific computer routine called
"rangeCheck,"

Oracle succeeded in copyrighting their API.  Had this happened in the days
of Unix, God only knows what kind of computing we'd have today.
