Auch, no.  Just wanting to test the water with one daft suggestion at a
time.

here is my objection, above the obvious leak issue. calculating

I suspect I may have a few ideas on how to do this efficiently, but I
haven't looked at the research yet to see what the state of play is and
what others may have done already.

the complexity in itself is wrong. this strength estimator will dwarf

there are other problems as well.

​Actually, that might not be the case.  I wouldn't have suggested this
design unless I thought it possible to create a complexity measure with a
simple algorithm (and no, I haven't got that far, was wanting to see
whether the main idea was workable first).

do we standardize the definition and the data? in this case, smartcard

or we allow different implementors to have different evaluation
algorithms. but this is wrong, because those algorithms must be
validated and reviewed. the very reason why we have standards is to
avoid all that hassle.

different algorithms is also wrong because in case of password reuse,
if you measure different login times, you will acquire multiple
subsets, the intersection of which the password in question will
reside in.

so i think this idea proves itself unfeasible for practicality
reasons.

​The objections you've highlighted here I had anticipated and *think* I
already have solutions for (the proof will be in the pudding though).  It
was more whether the side-channel was a deal-breaker for most people.
