Catena, Lyra2, Makwa, yescrypt are PHC's special recognitions. We'll
deliver packages (specs+code) of their final versions in Q3. Meanwhile,
minor changes can be made to the algorithms, but we need to agree on those.

@Submitters of C, L, M, y: Do you intend to make any changes to your
algorithms? If so, which ones?

I have no planned change on Makwa, neither on the algorithm nor the
package. In my opinion, the specification and the reference
implementations are "production ready" as they are today.

(But if there is popular demand for some feature that actually makes
sense, I am open to discussion, of course.)
