By the way, if you're familiar with results from skilled hand layout
of such circuits in advanced IC processes, I'd love to hear your
thoughts on Salsa20/8 latency with a custom hand-optimized layout in
the fastest processes.

Sorry, can't help you there; my knowledge is limited to the software
side of things. That said, your estimate does look reasonable: [1]
reports 4 cycles (one cycle per double-round) for the highest-area
implementation, 8 cycles at roughly half the area, or 32 cycles at 1/4th
of the area. The most efficient (in throughput/gates) is the second choice.
