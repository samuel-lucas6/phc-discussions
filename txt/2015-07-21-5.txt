Subject: Argon2 v1.0 versus v1.2

Hi all,

I just heard that Argon2 was announced the winner of the PHC. Congratulations to the Argon2 team, to the other teams, and to everyone else involved!

Over the next few days, I am planning to take a closer look at the Argon2 construction and analysis. I found two versions of the Argon2 spec online. The first is Argon2 v1.0, linked from the PHC website and dated 31 January 2015:

The second is Argon2 v1.2, posted on the authors’ Github repository and dated 8 July 2015:
  https://github.com/khovratovich/Argon2/blob/master/Argon2.pdf

Since the two versions use different “indexing functions," I imagine that the time-space trade-off for the two schemes could be quite different. Version 1.0 was the PHC winner, so I am tempted to spend my time looking at v1.0. At the same time, if v1.2 is the version that the world will use (assuming that the world starts using Argon2) I should probably focus on v1.2.

Is one of these two versions the "authoritative" one? Are there known flaws in v1.0 that provide a rationale for using only v1.2? I looked through the mailing list archives, but was not able to find any discussion of Argon2 v1.2.

Henry
