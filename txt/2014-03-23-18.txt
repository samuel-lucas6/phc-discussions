Subject: Re: [PHC] Can I have two entries?


escrypt is just not ready for PHC yet given the full set of
requirements I currently have for it

that is why i recommended earlier to drop the requirement of having
any implementation and test vectors in the first round. it should be
theoretical, and if your algorithm is not picked, there is absolutely
no reason to put that much effort in it. especially test vectors, they
should be like the absolute last step in the standardization process,
together with providing implementations for different platforms. these
steps are not even needed to be done by the original author, it is
just technicality.
