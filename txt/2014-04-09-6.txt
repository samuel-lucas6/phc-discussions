No.

This is how existing crypto protocols like TLS and CMS do it, typically you
denote the operation via some diversifier, e.g. TLS uses "CLNT" and "SRVR"
(actually for the MAC, but a similar thing), CMS uses:

  MAC-K := PRF( master_secret, "authentication" );
  CEK-K := PRF( master_secret, "encryption" );

(disclaimer: I wrote the RFC), and there are probably others.

Exactly.  I'm not sure if this is explicitly recorded anywhere, but it's
certainly part of the crypto folklore that you don't use the same PRF output
to generate keys for different purposes.
