Subject: Reworked KDF available on github for feedback: NOELKDF

I gave it a name this time.  It's based on the experience so far from
keystretch, but is simpler, and even faster.  It doesn't use a "key" to
hash pages, but instead treats the previously generated "page" as the key
for generating the next one by hashing it with a random previous page.  On
my Corei7 server, it runs about 15% slower than memmove (which is faster
than memcpy because 1/2 the memory is allocated).  2GB of hashing takes
0.35 seconds.  Both are multi-threaded 2-way, which is the fastest case on
both machines.

The code is at:

The name for NOELKDF comes from one of (I'm not saying which):

a) A contrived acronym of "Numerical Order Encryption Ladder" somehow
related to the ladder of hashed pages.
b) The name of my cat :-)
