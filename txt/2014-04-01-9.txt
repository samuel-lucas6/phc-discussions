Were it just floating point, but it is actually trignometic functions,
sin(), cos() and tan().

Never mind that they are hard to implement in hardware, they
are almost as hard to implement i software.

Almost all trig functions uses approximations and therfore it is
very common, amost expected, to see differences in the last bit of
the mantissa between different implementations or even the same
implementation on different platforms, compilers etc.

Using trig functions is almost guaranteed to be a total killer
for password portability, including across operating and hardware
upgrades to the intended computer.
