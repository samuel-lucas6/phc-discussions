One important point to check about the second article is whether it
talks about generic 2048-bit modular exponentiations, or about 2048-bit
RSA -- because the latter case implies a 4x speedup (thanks to the CRT).

The results in [2] are relative to raw 2048-bit exponentiation. [3] does RSA-2048 decryption instead, hence why I
referred to 1024-bit modular arithmetic.
