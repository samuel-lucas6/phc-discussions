This probably just shows my age, but I agree more with Poul-Henning
Kamp in this case.  Password hashing may get implemented in PHP or
Javascript, but the main implementation will be in C/C++.

The thought that we could develop the next generation PHS in Java
gives me the heebie-jeebies (and I am a Java fan).  How exactly are we
supposed to take into account SSE/AVX2, or AESENC instructions in
Java?  Imagine an EARWORM implementation in Python, Javascript, or
PHP.  Ug...

You can't do a good job at this with pencil and paper.  You have to
roll up your sleeves, write some code, benchmark, and iterate.
Otherwise, you'll only have a nice academic paper to show for your
work.  A nice high level language implementation would be a bonus, but
I just can't see tuning a PHS without going bare metal.
