Subject: Tweaks will no longer be accepted

The Jan 31 deadline is passed, therefore tweaks to algorithms
submitted to PHC will no longer be considered.

Nevertheless, we will accept revised documentations containing
editorial changes, or improved/bugfixed implementations. Submitters
are free to propose changes or improvements on this mailing list, but
there's no guarantee that those will be considered in the final PHC
selection.

Thank you
