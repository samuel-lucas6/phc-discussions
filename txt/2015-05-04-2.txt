      As an example, let the password hashing function H1 be ten times faster than H2, i.e., if Mallory's costs for H1 are be ten times
      higher than his costs for H2 (for the same budget on the defender's side). Ten times faster sounds like a big deal, doesn't it?


Mallory's cost will be 100X higher in this case.  Memory*time defense goes as the square of the runtime.  So, that's 6.64 additional bits of
strength, not 3.32.

No! Say H2 runs in 1 second allocating 10 MB, while H2, allocating the 
same 10 MB is ten times faster 0.1 second. If the defender is willing 
to wait 1 second, for either H1 or H2, H1 could then allocate 100 MB.

cost for H1: 100 sMB (seconds * Megabyte)

cost for H2: 10 sMb (sconds * Megabyte)

So the pseudo-entropy for H1 is 3.32 bit larger than the pseudo-entropy 
for H2, not 6.64.
