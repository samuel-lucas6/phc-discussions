Well, that's why I am tracking all my changes separately. The patch is here

To the overflow: just send small buffer of outlen size and see what strlen() will do in memmove
(without the patch).


Sorry, the way it is worded on the website made it sound to me like you
changed pufferfish() to raw output in PHS() and THEN receiving a buffer
overflow due to calling strlen() on the raw output. I see now what you
mean about strlen(hash) outlen due to the prepended setting string,
that would certainly cause a buffer overflow if the output buffer is
only outlen bytes.

Shrug... Yes. I can just say that PHS() simply produces non-random output
(because ASCII has high bits set to zero) and crashes because it is not
respecting outlen parameter and move along.

But I think it would be pity to remove nice algorithm from testing just because
of this small mistake... (And the first sentence in my tests says that
I am testing PHS() function only).

I'm not saying that, I'm saying don't judge the quality of the algorithm
by the quality of PHS() since PHS() is only used in this contest, and
not anywhere else.
