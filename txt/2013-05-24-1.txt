Subject: SSH key storage

Hi,

An interesting article (at least for me) on SSH private key storage and 
how the password is
derived (without stretching) to create a key for AES-CBC 
encrypt/decrypt the key.

http://martin.kleppmann.com/2013/05/24/improving-security-of-ssh-private-keys.html

The author also explain how to use PKCS#8 to benefit from PBKDF2.

I was already puzzled about the PGP scheme (see 
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/153>),
but I'm very surprised that the SSH default key storage scheme is so 
simple.
