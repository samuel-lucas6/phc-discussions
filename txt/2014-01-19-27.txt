That said, this may well be beyond scope of PHC (unless something
unexpectedly clever yet simple emerges), and Catena's builtin "server
relief" is only the tip of the iceberg.  It is very nice that Catena
standardizes just one hash type for both server-only and client+server
uses (without that functionality built in, it'd end up being 2+ hash
type variations), but it doesn't address the more complicated issues.

BTW, if I understood Catena's server relief design correctly, it looks
compatible with RFC 5802 (SCRAM), which I happened to have described in
my own words here (before I learned of the RFC):

http://openwall.info/wiki/people/solar/algorithms/challenge-response-authentication#Stored-on-the-server

For this algorithm to work, the server only needs H(Hs(password, salt)).

This is very nice if so, meaning that exact same standardized hash type
may be used for storage on the server both for SCRAM and for plaintext
logins (possibly over a secure tunnel).
