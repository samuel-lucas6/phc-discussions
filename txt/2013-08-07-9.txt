In your example, you set hash to be HMAC-SHA256. What requirements on hash

Honestly that was arbitrary. I think it could work more like
Jean-Philippe's, computing hashes up front of the password/salt, then using
an unkeyed hash function for each step in the chains.

Re: SHA256, I was just following suit with the other examples. It could
easily use e.g. Blake2b instead.
