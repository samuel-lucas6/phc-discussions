Thus, yescrypt v1's output for a shorter length is always a prefix of
its output for a longer length.  I'd appreciate you re-testing yescrypt
for this property.

This test is output from original submission (with special case):
https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/Lenovo_X230_i5_4G/o_len/yescrypt.dat

And now the version 1:
https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/o_len/yescrypt.dat
https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/o_len/yescrypt-sse.dat

So it works as expected.

Thanks!  It would also be helpful if you test the same for g 0, which
exposes additional relevant code paths that are not available via PHS().
