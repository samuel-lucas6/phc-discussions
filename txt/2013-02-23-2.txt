Is there any direct web access for the archive where the list is hosted?  I
can't find that in the subscription information.

PS: I'd prefer not to have to use GMane for this list when I don't use it
for anything else.  Ditto for NNTP.  (I'm not objecting to GMane, just
concerned that it be the only archive access.)
