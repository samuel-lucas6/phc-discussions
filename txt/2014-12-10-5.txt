Read the Bcrypt paper if you haven't already. It's a great paper
about a great password hashing scheme.
https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix99/provos/provos.pdf

But observe the ambiguity it leaves for implementers wishing to
make a bug-free and compatible implementation.

Observe the lack of a portable reference implementation.

Observe the lack of a diverse set of test vectors.


you know, these are pretty good points. i personally don't like
bcrypt, but it is undoubtedly delivers what it promises. and also you
can find a lot of applications and a lot of love for it. i myself
implemented it, and i've never read the original paper. i used the
openbsd source and 3rd party implementations. for all i care, the
original paper could be in chinese. i was able to implement keccak
based on the papers, but only after a lot of trial and error. yet,
keccak was selected anyway, for the soundness of the *algorithm*.
