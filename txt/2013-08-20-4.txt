IIRC in previous Twitter discussions an idea was to avoid the word
"hash" altogether and some people proposed things like "password
scramblers". Also, a good name should probably include a connotation
of work factor/slowness.

Password Storage Scheme?

Granted, you're not storing the password, but that's what people are
looking for. I have several articles on password authentication, and by far
the most popular queries that find them are "password storage", "how to
store passwords", and "storing passwords securely". Remember, people aren't
looking for slow hash functions--they often don't know it needs to be slow
at all. People who *do* know this aren't going to care if it's called a
hash, a scrambler or a "password twister."

"Scramble" is correct, but nobody understands what this means, and to a lot
of people it sounds less secure than "encryption" or "hashing".

IMO, "pash" is never going to get picked up. At best it's a cute term we'll
use, at worst it'll cause more ambiguity around "hash".

In any case, I agree that "hash" is bad, if only because it makes a
construction suitable for password authentication seem too similar to
normal hash functions.

Please! I'm tired of putting scare-quotes around "hash" every time I
write about this. One of our goals is to make things easier services to do
things properly. I still remember the people complaining that BLAKE2 was
bad because it was too fast. Separate terms will help make it clear that
different things have different design goals.

Nice. I think I might start using that terminology right away. I don't
think we need to wait for contest results to start doing this.

(I'd also like something for KDFs that are designed to have a work
factor for when the function output isn't for authentication.  "k-desh" for
"Key Derivation ScHeme"? But as this the the PHC project and not the KDF-C
project, my additional wishes here are off-topic.)
