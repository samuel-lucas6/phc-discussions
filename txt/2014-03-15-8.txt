You might want to change:

This way the attacker can't do anything until you get the data from $v.

Thanks!  I wanted to have this sequential on $x, but we achieve that via
$j being dependent on $x anyway, so you're right - we can introduce the
other sequential dependency here.

Upon a closer look, I think your proposed change is problematic in that
there are not that many different $j's, so some will repeat (the
attacker may then benefit from having cached SHA-512 contexts) and/or so
that speculative precomputation of the possible SHA-512's (to the point
of finally needing $x) might be practical if an attacker can have lots
of SHA-512 cores cheaply.  I doubt those attacks will be practical (the
overhead is probably too high), but I can't rule that out.

As to giving both defenders and attackers some time to fetch data from
memory by processing $x first, I think this may be fine.  It might
benefit some defenders' implementations more than attackers', because
attackers can always bring in more parallelism to hide the latency.
Yes, doing so costs those attackers memory, so it's not obvious who
benefits more.

Since $x is only half the size of a SHA-512 block, the amount of
computation that can be performed while waiting for data from $v is
limited to a portion of SHA-512's message scheduling and a few rounds.

That said, a hybrid approach might work better, where a smaller portion
of $x (but with more possible values than $j has) is processed first,
followed by data read from $v, and optionally(?) followed by full $x.
Since we have first 4 bytes of $x in $ja[1] anyway, maybe we can do:

$v .= $x = hash('sha512', $ja[1] . substr($v, $j, $blocksize1) . $x, TRUE);

and:

$x = hash('sha512', $ja[1] . substr($v, $j, $blocksize2) . $x, TRUE);

but is this worth the added PHP overhead?
