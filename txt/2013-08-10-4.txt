Personally, I think the fact that C99 is nearly 15 years old and not
even the current version of the standard anymore is sufficient
justification to say "C" means a language which includes all C99
features (except perhaps those which C11 made optional).

I just checked, and VLAs are in this category.  I think that's sufficient
justification for avoiding them. Barring any contrary recommendations from
panel members, I think I'll nix those but hold on to the rest.
