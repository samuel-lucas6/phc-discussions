 2. Under the given PHC threat scenario, it is assumed that K is
disclosed and the work factor for discovering a k0 (or k0'
collision) value by off-line attack is daunting enough and of
limited value (i.e., that value is not reused in any other setting).
That work factor applies to H, not the PBKDF.

brute forcing passwords is feasible because of the typical low entropy
of passwords. brute forcing a true 128 bit space is unfeasible, and
will be unfeasible for quite some time. brute forcing a 256 bit space
is unimaginable.
