Should the "standardization phase" be public

Yes, please.  But panel members should have a final say.

(thus after selection and announcing winners)

Not necessarily.  We may as well discuss standardization-related
proposals for finalists before we've selected winners, and our ability
to come up with good ways to standardize a finalist might affect its
selection as a winner.

or not (thus by panel members only, after
selecting but before announcing winners)?

I think we should avoid/minimize whatever delays there might be between
making and announcing any decision.  So I dislike this option.

Should it be public, a risk is that it degenerates into CFRG-like
bikeshedding...

It should be the panel's responsibility to make decisions in a timely
manner, regardless of whatever bikeshedding there might be on this
mailing list.
