hydra7 (Intel Sandy Bridge) seems to have AES-NI implementations, which

Nice, thanks for the pointer! It's quite interesting to see ChaCha8 is
indeed faster than AES-128 on these architectures.

I don't really doubt that the AES implementation (which appears to come
from cryptopp) is using AES-NI, but untangling the SUPERCOP source code is
a bit difficult for me.
