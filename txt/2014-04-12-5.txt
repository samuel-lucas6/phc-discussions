Hi,

What happened to Catfish?  Was it withdrawn by the authors?  Why?

I just noticed it's no longer downloadable from
https://password-hashing.net/candidates.html

Are we sure we want to be removing downloads for withdrawn entries?
Maybe just mark them withdrawn, but keep the ability to download, unless
we have to remove the downloads for legal reasons?

Alexander
