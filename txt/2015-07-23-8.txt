It would be good to hear from the Argon2 team about this concept.  I would
be happy to attempt to merge the two algorithms with a tri-state parameter,
as a fork on github.  Would that be worthwhile?

I'm glad to hear Alexander has benchmarks showing low impact when
integrating maxform.  That's great news.  Where is the code?  I prefer the
code to any other description.
