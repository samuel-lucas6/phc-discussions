can someone explain me how omegacrypt does not leak secret through 
timing? i mean total runtime, not cache timing.

in the central part, we derive 0..3 number B from the secret, and 
based on that value we do different branches that has different
number of operations. B will on average have all possible values
with the same probability, but there will be a deviation. therefore
for two given passwords, the total running time is different.

i understand that memory latency screws up such fine grained
timing, making practical attacks difficult. but theoretically there
is a leak. am i right?


Yes, OmegaCrypt leaks some data through runtime.

However, AntCrypt, OmegaCrypt, and Schvrch all tried to introduce data
based branching for GPU defense, and "cyclomatic complexity".  I am
not sure we've seen this idea implemented well yet, and data-based
branching has been considered a no-no for years apparently.  However,
when 3 authors all invent the same thing, I think we should take a
closer look.
