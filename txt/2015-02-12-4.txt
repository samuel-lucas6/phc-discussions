But, I found that this kind of effort in the PHC is missing. Instead of
saying encouraging words or describing good points of each algorithm, the
report says like this,

That is indeed how the later stage SHA-3 reports are done. However, I went back and looked at the SHA-3 Round 1 report
[1], which would be the rough analogous to the phase we are in right now. There is no comment on the 37 rejected
candidates beyond some initial generalities about criteria (which, as you pointed out, were mainly security and
performance). I am quite confident each of these rejections are fully justified, but the report is definitely not where
one will find them. Similarly, Phase 1 of the eSTREAM competition yielded no formal report at all (that I can find; I
only found [2]), simply a selection.
