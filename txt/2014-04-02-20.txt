Sorry if I am making you more confused.

By "chose little endian to be compatible with Keccak", I meant we are
trying to use the same bit and byte ordering conventions as Keccak's, in
order to avoid possible confusions when someone wants to implement both
Keccak and Catfish by himself/herself.
But it should not matter if you treat Keccak as a black box and just link
some Keccak libs.

If you are interested, you can read more info about Keccak's bit/byte
ordering in its specs at
http://keccak.noekeon.org/Keccak-implementation-3.2.pdf.  (Sec 1.2, Page 9).

Thanks.

 Hi Steve,

Thanks for your interest in our design and especially the source code.

The pkhash_slow() was modified from one piece of old code, and it was
using big endian.
I was in a hurry to complete the C ref code to be submitted to the
competition.
That's the reason why it seems a little weird.

It is perfectly fine if you can implement the pkhash in little endian.

  I think there is an issue with endian in Catfish. E verywhere in
catfish() it is little
 endian until it gets  passed into pkhash_slow() then it thinks it's big
endian and
 "in" is  "reverse for little-endian". Then is used as little endian.
Although this
 doesn't really matter since the input  is  from keccak. It just seems
weird.

  I guess I'm either confused or being confusing, are you suppose to read
the output
 of  keccak as little or big endian .
