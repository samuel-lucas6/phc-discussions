If you plan on updating this, you may want to rerun the
endianess-support test for catena. Most of the functionality is now
endianess independent. Keyed hashing and key generation still rely on
endianess detection. Sadly I didn't have any access to actual
big-endian hardware, but it worked as expected on a emulated ppc.

With the updated patches from git it now passes generated
vectors on big-endian platform for both Catena instances.

I added patch to updating to git version to my repository,
I hope I can run the tests again soon...

Thanks!
