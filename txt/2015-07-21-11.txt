If Alexander proposed to integrate his PWXFORM (I don't know what MAXFORM
is), then I would be for it.  This would satisfy my request for improved
GPU resistance, and also my request for multiplication-chain computation
time hardening.

There are only two really outstanding SIMD-optimized mixing functions which
were used in this competition, IMO.  The choices are the reduced-Blake2
with or without it's multiplication modification, and PWXFORM.  I suspect
between Samuel Neves, Alexander, and the Argon2 team, they could figure out
the best solution.

Thanks,
Bill
