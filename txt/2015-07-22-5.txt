Subject: Re: [PHC] Argon2 improvement thread

There's been some additions to the document, mainly by Bill (thanks!)

There's 3 main tweaks proposed to the algorithm:
1. blamka
2. maxform
3. non-linear indexing

Point 3. looks like a no-brainer to me; any objection?

@Bill, Solar (and others): blamka and maxform, respectively in Argon2i and
2d, is that what you have in mind, of maxform in both?

@Dmitry: what do you think? any other proposal of improvement?

Let's keep collecting feedback and ideas about
implementation/API/parameters/etc. We'll decide on those after we're done
with the actual algorithm.

I've been asked about how and by whom tweaks will be accepted. There should
at least be the ok of the designers and general agreement of the panel and
other no major objection.
