If so, why not for lower sizes as well?  Do you mention this as the
lower boundary just in case, since Pufferfish (and bcrypt, but it's not
in PHC) might win at some really low sizes (perhaps way below 1 MiB)?

Only 2x worse while completely lacking computation latency hardening?
Are you sure it's safe to rely solely on memory latency and bandwidth?
Previously, you were not so sure.


Well, there is no "multiplication hardening" or anything of the sort if
we assume that the underlying sponge is Blake2, but that is not strictly
the case: Lyra2 does not impose any restriction on what is the
underlying hash, as it was designed as a sponge-based wrapper around a
hash function. We did use Blake2 in our implementation, but any
iterative hash function would do the trick.

Notice that this characteristic can be considered good ("it is
flexible") or bad ("it transfers the burden of the choice to the user"),
depending on how you see it, so I cannot say that this is any kind of
advantage of Lyra2 over any other candidate.
