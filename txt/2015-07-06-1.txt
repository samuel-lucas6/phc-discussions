I guess I am more concerned about ASICs.  People still enjoyed LiteCoin
mining with GPUs, but ASICs ruined the BitCoin party for a lot of people.

I _think_ the ROM defends well against an ASIC attack.  So would
mutiplication chains and the random small memory I/O operations.  However,
an ASIC attack will probably run at it's I/O bandwidth to memory.

I suspect Alexander already knows how to build hardware to defeat the
memory-hardness of my proposed ROM defense:

Build a distributed ROM, where each of p ROM nodes has n/p ROM entries of
an n-entry ROM.  Build any sort of routing network you like from these p
ROM nodes to p hashing nodes.  The ROM data may have high latency through
that network, but you get on something around p/2 ROM reads per network
latency.  With high enough p, you defeat the memory-hardness property of
the defense.

So, I think we can't count on ROM to provide memory-hard defense.  As
Alexander said, it's shared, and that's the problem.

Worse, while I did not go into detail about it, I think neither Momentu nor
Cuckoo are memory-hard.  I'll post that to the meltzdown crypto-list.
