Er... yes?  I am thinking about it, but I may be making mistakes.  I'm
running 2 threads on my dev machine, but I think 4 SSE instructions in
parallel may be better, and I could do that with interleaving the
memory.  Until I get some experience with SSE, all I can do is guess.
I'm guessing I may be able to double my memory bandwidth, but I really
don't know.

Have you thought about doing 4 (or more) multiplies in parallel:
4 multiplies with SSE4.1 (PMULLD _mm_mullo_epi32)
8 multiplies with AVX2 (VPMULLD _mm256_mullo_epi32)
16 multiplies with AVX-512 (VPMULLD _mm512_mullo_epi32)

You can reorder the values in any order in SSE2 with PSHUFD
(_mm_shuffle_epi32). Reordering the values in AVX2 and AVX-512 is
trickier and may need multiple instructions.

SSE4.1 has been on pretty much every Intel CPU since 2008. AVX2
just came out last year with Haswell. I think integer AVX-512 will be on
Skylake in 2015. They could delay integer operations until the next
iteration in 2017 like they did with AVX/AVX2. AVX-512 should probably
be considered since this competition will end when AVX-512 is
estimated to be available or on the horizon.
