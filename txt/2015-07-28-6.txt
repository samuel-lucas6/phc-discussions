We'll deliver packages (specs+code) of their final versions in Q3.
Meanwhile, minor changes can be made to the algorithms, but we need
to agree on those.

@Submitters of C, L, M, y: Do you intend to make any changes to
your algorithms? If so, which ones?


Hi,

we do not plan to make any changes to the algorithm of Catena.
Nevertheless, we plan to update the reference implementation and the
specification paper regarding to the descriptions of Blake2b-1,
mention Catena-Axungia (search tool to find optimal parameters),
mention Catena-Variants (implementation of Catena that allows
extension and mofidication), and correcting some indices to ensure
consistency throughout the whole document.

Best regards,
Jakob
