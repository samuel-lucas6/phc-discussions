The Argon team does great work, but they continually warp there conclusions
to favor their incorrect world-view that the original Argon algorithm is
better than all the rest.  They use outlandish definitions for common
things like "time*memory" defense, and wafer-sized ASICs holding zero
latency multi-gigabyte nearly-zero power cache RAM.

Other than that, this paper is a great analysis...

Here's the outrageous claim they make against Yescrypt:

  for 1/4 memory, Yescrypt has a 1/2 "Time-memory product"

In their previous table, they say that at a 1/4 memory attack, the attacker
must do 1135 times more computation.  The time*memory defense as used by
the whole world other than the Argon team is therefore 283.75.  This paper
is off by a factor of 567.5!

I do not consider this a weakness of Yescrypt.  I wish the Argon team would
start using proper terminology.
