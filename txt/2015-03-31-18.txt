Surely blake2b_update() then uses its own choice of integer or SIMD
types for this data.

The BLAKE2 code does not treat input bytes as anything other than bytes. Whenever there is a need to convert bytes to
integers, this is done in a standards-compliant way (using either memcpy to a local variable, or plain load-shift-or).
