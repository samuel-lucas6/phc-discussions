Right.

then this is quite
a bit faster than the default scrypt install on Arch Linux, Core
i7-3770:

Scrypt: 0.5 GiB in 1.8 seconds
Escript: 1 GiB in 1.4 seconds

This sounds about right to me.  (I assume you used escrypt in scrypt
compat mode here.)

This is single threaded, and includes memory allocation overhead.  I
tried p 1, but it didn't reduce the runtime for some reason.

Don't forget that in scrypt p>1 increases the total memory allocation
accordingly.  So e.g. with p=2, you process 2 GiB.  For example, on
i7-4770K with 4x DDR3-1600 (2 channels):

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 1) = 21 01 cb 9b 6a 51 1a ae ad db be 09 cf 70 f8 81 ec 56 8d 57 4a 2f fd 4d ab e5 ee 98 20 ad aa 47 8e 56 fd 8f 4b a5 d0 9f fa 1c 6d 92 7c 40 f4 c3 37 30 40 49 e8 a9 52 fb cb f4 5c 6f a7 7a 41 a4

sys     0m0.200s

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 8) = 9a 6c 46 65 c4 cc b5 8b 60 53 dd fd 6d 48 bb 3a 71 ba 8f ae b7 dc 35 99 a6 b6 10 fc e3 52 d6 3f df 50 53 bd cd 19 a4 cc 05 85 f7 e5 a5 ae 6e 68 41 a3 47 1a be 86 86 28 2e 07 b2 49 2b 3e f8 6b

real    0m2.359s
user    0m14.081s
sys     0m2.292s

This is 1 GiB in 1.5 seconds, or 8 GiB in 2.4 seconds.  Both including
memory allocation overhead.

Of course, due to the way classic scrypt's thread-level parallelism
works, the same "8 GiB" result may also be computed sequentially using
just 1 GiB of memory.  With OMPFLAGS_MAYBE in Makefile commented out:

$ time ./tests 
scrypt("pleaseletmein", "SodiumChloride", 1048576, 8, 8) = 9a 6c 46 65 c4 cc b5 8b 60 53 dd fd 6d 48 bb 3a 71 ba 8f ae b7 dc 35 99 a6 b6 10 fc e3 52 d6 3f df 50 53 bd cd 19 a4 cc 05 85 f7 e5 a5 ae 6e 68 41 a3 47 1a be 86 86 28 2e 07 b2 49 2b 3e f8 6b

real    0m10.683s
user    0m10.453s
sys     0m0.204s

I think keeping compatibility with scrypt is a great idea for escript.
 Regardless of the PHC, escrypt is a faster and improved scrypt, and
as such should see plenty of use.

I think I'll also release a cut-down version of the escrypt tree, with
scrypt functionality only (but better performance and more flexible API
than upstream scrypt's).  In fact, I already had escrypt-lite with just
this functionality, but so far it only exists in JtR -jumbo tree (for
cracking of scrypt hashes), and it's a bit out of date as compared to
scrypt-relevant changes made in escrypt since then.  So I'll need to
bring it up to date and release it separately.

And yes, I also intend to keep scrypt compat in escrypt (or whatever
it'll be called), at least for now.

As to dealing with complexity, I think we can have one-design-fits-most
(due to tunable sizing), and also have cut-down implementations
supporting only a subset of tunable settings (or/and narrower ranges).
For example, an implementation of escrypt intended for Unix crypt(3)
wouldn't support the ROM, yet hashes computed by it will also be among
those computable by the full (large and complex) escrypt.

If you're interested in something
completely different than scrypt, you're still invited to work on
tigerkdf :-p  It's already mostly your and Christian Forler's ideas
anyway.

Thank you for the invitation!  I'd be happy to contribute to TigerKDF
more, and to do so more directly, but the PHC submission deadline is too
soon and I still have a lot of work to do on escrypt.  So I am not sure.
