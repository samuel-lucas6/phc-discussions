My understanding of the ANT scheme described at 
<http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=252097>.

The key to this scheme is that an Encode is such that, without Decode, a decryption does not reveal enough about known-plaintext characteristics to signal to an attacker that they are on the wrong track or not.  In particular, it is not enough to use a single decrypted-trial block to determine that the trial key is incorrect.  

This is a big deal in document formats and document container systems that have predictable early structure, as in OOXML, ODF, and EPUB documents (where the ODF case is fairly notorious because it encrypts document components individually and implementations have tended to include known, fixed boilerplate components that are independent of document content and there are other structural clues such as expecting XML and HTML forms).

For encrypt-then-MAC, there is the problem that testing a key for failing to verify the MAC becomes the next attacker opportunity for "rapid" key-trial rejection, especially for short ciphertexts.  Even though the defender only has to do this once (with a correct, known key) and the attacker is not quite so fortunate, the problem is that we're still talking about password-based encryption and the fundamental weakness of that remains so long as defender encryption-decryption must remain practical.  

The short-message case seems bothersome all around, although one could crank up the work-factor parameters of the key derivation operation given a short plaintext.  But that is not much compared to making the key extremely strong and never reused instead [;<).

A question I wanted to ask at the talk but didn't get the chance...

I guess with Encrypt-then-MAC an attacker can still just check the MAC but that would involve;

a) calculating the MAC key, which is typically chained off the encryption key possibly with additional work factor

b) streaming the entire cipher text through the hash function

Whether this is faster than skipping the MAC key derivation and hash step and going straight to decrypting the entire ciphertext and applying the ANT I guess could vary. But in any case it's a better lower bound than decrypting just one block.

Is that right?
