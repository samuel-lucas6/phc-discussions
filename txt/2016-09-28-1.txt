Subject: Re: [PHC] Can we add back Argon2id?

The rationale was to offer better tradeoff resistance for the 1-pass
version. Maybe it was not worth it.

Currently we the designers would welcome the appearance of Argon2id in the
official implementation. Care must be taken to maintain compatibility, but
this should better be addressed at the community working on the
implementation on GitHub.

Best regards,
the Argon2 team

If I could change Argon2 to only offer Argon2i and Argon2id, I would.  The
complexity is the same as offering only Argon2i and Argon2d, but Argon2id
provides better defense than Argon2d.  I do not understand the rationale
for promoting Argon2d instead of Argon2id.
