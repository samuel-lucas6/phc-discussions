I'm pretty sure that this is a common time span for at least some scenarios.

moore's law says 3% increase per month, 20% in half year. if our
security margin is so low we can't afford that, we are screwed anyway,
and it is time to ditch password based identification.

I just personally have a great aversion of forgotten password routines
when it comes to usability and security. Maybe I just haven't seen a
good one yet.

i agree that security is effectively nonexistent. but improving it is
another story. launch the PRPC. as far as usability goes, i see no
problem resetting a password after a year. i do it for some sites 3-4
times a year, minor annoyance. maybe i just got used to it.
