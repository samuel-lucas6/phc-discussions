Subject: Strengths

I went through and remove extra words, redundant, vague, and pointless items.
Let me know if I went a little overboard or missed some. I also tried to have
them all be similar like "Anti-GPU with divergent code" and "Fast with AES-NI (*
round AES)". Maybe I didn't pick the best names. If you do have write access to
the wiki and want to change the wording, please check all the other algorithms
and change those accordingly.

Also is it "server-specific shortcut" or "server specific shortcut"?

I almost removed "client independent update" and "server relief" because I felt
these could be added to most algorithms with a couple lines of code (tweak).

Client independent update is basically just:
// updates >= 0
for (i = 0; i <= updates; i++)
{
    PHS(out, outlen, in, inlen, salt, saltlen, t_cost, m_cost << i);
    // or this if m_cost is a log2 of memory usage
//  PHS(out, outlen, in, inlen, salt, saltlen, t_cost, m_cost + i);
    // or this if increased memory usage is not desired
//  PHS(out, outlen, in, inlen, salt, saltlen, t_cost, m_cost);
    in = out;
    inlen = outlen;
}

Server relief is basically just returning a hash of "out" instead of out. Server
relief can probably be add to some algorithms without even changing the
algorithm just return "out" before the final processing.

Hopefully I didn't overstep my boundaries with my edits.
The changes are here (2014/04/14 20:29 to 2014/04/14 21:15):
