Subject: "natural" conference / workshop for PHC

Hello,

If this is a FAQ, then please point it out to me and I will make my
best effort at looking embarrassed.

When the candidates are all submitted and published (in less than two
months now), where will they be discussed ? The AES and SHA-3 competitions
had dedicated conferences, where the candidates were discussed at length.
Am I right to assume that Passwords (as in "http://passwordscon.org/")
will play this role ? I.e. that this will be the "place to be" for PHC ?

On a similar vein, will there be a dedicated time somewhere for
submitters to "make their case" (e.g. 15 minutes for each submitter to
explain with slides how marvellous their creation is) ?
