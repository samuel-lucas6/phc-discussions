Subject: Re: [PHC] Lyra, Password Key Derivation Based On The Sponge Construction

Please feel free to borrow any idea I might have inspired, and even feel
free to copy/paste my code, which I'm making public domain.  I honestly
feel bad about incorporating such great ideas from Catena and escrypt.  I
hope I've offered some useful ideas, but there is clearly more great stuff
coming from those guys.  Experience in a field does make a difference.

Bill
