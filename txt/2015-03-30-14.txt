Yes, I'll plan to look into this soon.

It is not there because I did not find any mention that POMELO can 
be used directly as a KDF in the paper (and the use case is for 
KDF). The garbage-collector attack paper 
http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881 also mentions that it is not KDF
in Table 4.

Could authors clarify that?

Hi,

we did not mark POMELO as a KDF for the following reasons:

The authors of POMELO (v2)
1) ...did not claim that POMELO can be used as a KDF
2) ...neither claimed nor proved randomness of the outputs which is
   required for a good KDF

Best regards,
Jakob
(one of the authors of http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881)
