Since we don't know what area/latency/throughput tradeoffs
Intel/AMD/future ARM licensees made when implementing AES-NI, it is
possible that an FPGA/ASIC attacker could have a significant advantage
over the defender. 

This doesn't worry me.  We already take for granted the defender is
paying for the die area necessary to implement a thousand opcodes that
aren't AESENC.  Whatever shortcuts that Intel took in the implmentation
of the AES circuits are, by comparison, noise.

As I wrote in my reply to CodesInChaos, my security model for EARWORM
assumes that the attacker gets AES circuits for free.  The FPGA/ASIC
attacker's advantage is determined by the extent to which he can improve
on the defender's memory architecture in order to pay less for ROM
bandwidth.
