Given how much email I personally get, any "mandatory subscription"
demands tends to piss me off a fair bit, so I'm very weary about
doing that to other people.

I think we should make it clear that discussions@ is where the
trouble starts, but leave it up to the submitters to decide if they
want to fence for their creation, or just let it float.
