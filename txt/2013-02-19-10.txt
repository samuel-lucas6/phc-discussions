Yes, PHS() is defined to accept inlen, but in many scripting languages
and in many other APIs NULs may be problematic anyway.

Should PHS() support embedded NULs even when the password hashing
scheme's primary implementation - one intended for actual use - does not
support embedded NULs?  Well, perhaps it should...

Does there exist a scripting language that's so broken with respect to
dealing with embedded nulls that it's unreasonable for us to expect the
primary implementation of our scheme to deal with them properly?
