Subject: Re: [PHC] PHC status report

Hi everyone,

I am a PHC judge, but in this email I am speaking for myself.

It seems that the concern (FUD?) expressed in this thread is simply about
the inclusion of these two additional requirements:

1. Elegance of design
2. Originality and innovation

As far as I can tell, whether the finalists meet these criteria isn't even
in question, merely the criteria themselves, and the fact they weren't on
the original list.

My personal opinion is that these additional requirements are parsimonious
with the original requirements and do not represent a substantal deviation
from what was stated initially.

Perehaps I am party to the criminal conspiracy being alleged here (by an
ex-NIST member, nonetheless) but I really think the concerns and
accusations being leveled in this thread are completely overblown.

That said, I think making at least the vote public is a good idea. J-P has
my permission to publish my vote.
