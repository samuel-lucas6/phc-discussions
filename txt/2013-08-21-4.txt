The other thing that came to mind from Marsh's original post concerned the other data that services often store alongside the password, e.g. personal data and the "forget password" question & answer.  I know this is out of scope but it probably deserves discussion at some point as it's all very well for us to solve the password hash problem but if the "forget password" answers are stored in plaintext we've not done much (and many email accounts are compromised by that very route). 

At first blush the same algorithm used to hash passwords could be used to hash "forget password" answers.
