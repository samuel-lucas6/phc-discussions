If you compute H(salt || domain || password) when
talking to a remote URL, and send an ASCII hash digest instead of a
password, you gain a lot of protection, regardless of what hashing algorithm
the remote server uses.

it is a very good client side password management option, but you need
a costly H to be secure. developing such a H is our task here :)
