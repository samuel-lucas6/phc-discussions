On Wed, Apr 23, 2014 at 5:48 PM, Bill Cox I coded this for fun, based on
Lyra2's modified version of Blake2b.  I'm not confident it's secure, but it
does run fast.  It hashes files almost 3.5 GB/s, or just over 1 byte per
clock.  Here's some speed comparisons:

wghash (as I'm calling this hack): 3.48 GB/s
md5sum: 0.72 GB/s
sha256sum: 0.29 GB/s

Running 4 threads in parallel maxes out my memory bandwidth, doing 12.5
GB/s (note: GB, not GiB).  It verified 2GB in around 0.18 seconds.
