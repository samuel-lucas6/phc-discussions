Subject: Template for submissions?

This is a dumb question... sorry!  The requirements say there should be a
cover page and several specific sections.  Is there a template available
for LibreOffice, or should I just wing it?  My preference for document
editing is vim, and MarkDown, so if there isn't any preference on the
receiver's side, I'll probably just send a .md file.

Thanks
Bill
