Subject: Re: [PHC] Re: Suggestion: API should include a verifier function

So upon further reflection, I really think the threat model of PHC is: the
attacker has the password hash. If you can solve that problem, the issue of
timing attacks should be irrelevant (I think this was e.g. Solar Designer's
point)

There's been quite interesting discussion to the contrary however.

I still think a verifier API is probably a good idea, regardless? If
nothing else, I think a separate verifier API is a good cryptographer <=>
end user interface ;)

This isn't necessary: a non-constant time comparison at worst reveals the
hash, which doesn't give an attacker
enough information to break a password anyway if we do our jobs right.
