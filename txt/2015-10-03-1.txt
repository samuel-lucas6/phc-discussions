OTOH this points to another question: why did use unsigned long type
at all?

It is for wider compatibility. Though the year is 2015, not all
programming environments are up to compatiblity with C99 and thus may
lack <stdint.hand its convenient types like uint32_t. Similarly, I do
not use C99-isms like mixing declarations and statements. I aim at C89
compatibility.

The 'unsigned int' type may be smaller than 32 bits. This is especially
true of some embedded platforms, either because of backward
compatibility with previous software, or because the platform really is
16-bit. The 'unsigned long' type, however, is guaranteed to offer at
least 32 bits.
