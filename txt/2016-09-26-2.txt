one vote against. if the attack model includes side channels, 2i is
the way to go. if it does not, 2d. 2id would be useful if the attack
model sorta included side channels, but sorta didn't. or we don't
care, but want to check the box. i don't see the realism in this
scenario.

My understanding is that 2id addresses the case where the sidechannel
concern is that the sidechannel allows fast memory free elimination of
candidate passwords, but otherwise you don't care about the side
channel.

Personally, I was disappointed that PHC anointed anything which wasn't
at least this strong-- sidechannels are a reality and are fiendishly
difficult to defend against except by architecture. It seems
irresponsible to disregard them as completely as fully dynamic
algorithms do.
