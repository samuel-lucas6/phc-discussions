You're not the first author to feel it would be too much like Solar
Designer's work to make a nice improvement.

I like everything about yescrypt except for its complexity. I hope that
EARWORM, which is much simpler, holds up well. But if it doesn't, and it
turns out that a medium-to-large RAM is truly necessary in order to
achieve acceptable security levels, then I think the better path to
perfection consists of ripping unnecessary things out of yescrypt, not
bolting new ones onto EARWORM.

EARWORM is well differentiated from yescript, IMO.  It is a slimmer
simpler special purpose tool.  The reliance on AESENC instructions and
the super fast read-only hashing sets it apart.

EARWORM's hashing speed is certainly a selling point, but its reliance
specialized CPU features certainly isn't!

My theoretical attack boarders on a banana attack, but I think it's
worth keeping in mind. I wouldn't make the change you're suggesting in
response to it.  I really do like EARWORM the way it is.

Even if the change doesn't significantly mitigate any known attack, on
further reflection I think EARWORM is currently breaking a cardinal rule
of cryptographic design: unnecessary structure is bad! I guess I can
postpone my decision on EARWORM until the next round, but the
GPU-friendly variant I'm developing (it's going to be called GLOWWORM)
is definitely going to have a flat arena.
