 Since an authentication scheme for password-based credentials has a

digesting, MACing, and even key derivation, we should strongly consider
giving it a different name. The values derived from the generate function.
For example, we could call it a “pash function” or “pash values”, which you
could think of as “Password Authentication ScHeme” or just “Password Hash”.

I wonder if tying these type of functions to passwords at all is misguided.
"Password hashing functions" have uses outside of passwords. They're useful
for any system where you want to survive the compromise of a PRG which
deterministically acts on some type of low-entropy data (but takes a key,
or "salt", of course)

What about calling them slow hashes?
