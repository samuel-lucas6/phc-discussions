This may be a first step towards addressing Bill's criticism about
lacking bullet points - they are right there on the slides now. ;-)

I realize I do need to improve the specification document as well, and
to contribute to the wiki.

A second step is mostly done: I've just heavily revised the wiki page on
yescrypt, which now has "Strengths summary", "Strengths in detail", and
even "Drawbacks".
