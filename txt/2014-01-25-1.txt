Subject: Initial (non-proof-read) NeolKDF paper

I just did a git commit, and have not even read this paper once.  It
still needs spelling and grammar corrections, diagrams showing the
three DAG styles I compare, and a lot of work in general.  This is
definitely an 'alpha'.  So, if you want to wait for the real paper,
please ignore this message.

If you would like to see the earliest version and maybe provide some
constructive feedback, please feel free to take a look.  It's at:
