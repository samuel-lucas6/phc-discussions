 "memory-hard"approaches and amortized attack costs.

From: Dimitri Fousekis [mailto:dimitri@...space.co.za] 
Is there an adversary classification that has been designed?
Taking into account what the adversary may or may not
have access to and specifically the budget and thus
computational power they may have?

And whether the adversary's goal is to crack:
A. Just one password for any account 
B. The password for one specific account
C. One password out of a specific group (say admins)
D. As many as practical. E.g., for resale or for a customer pentest report.
E. All passwords. E.g., password researchers or enthusiasts with bored GPUs :-)
