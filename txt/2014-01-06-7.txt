Subject: Password corpuses

Can anyone suggest good sources to obtain large password corpuses/lists?
 As part of my intended algorithm, I'll need to develop a scalar complexity
measure for candidate passwords so will need as much in-the-wild data as
possible to fit the model against.

Also, on a completely tangential note: does anyone know if the plural of
'corpus' in this context is 'corpuses' or 'corpora', online resources seem
less than helpful.

Thanks,

Peter
