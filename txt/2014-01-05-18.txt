Subject: Re: [PHC] Proposed timeline changes

Not that my opinion should hold much weight here - I'm just dabbling after
all - but the one thing said that I strongly agree with is that submitters
should be allowed to "borrow" each other's ideas in the second phase,
potentially making major changes to their algorithms.

However we won't accept submissions after the initial deadline. And
round
2 is about shortlisting a few submissions rather than receiving new
ones.
The game has to have rules :)

I think many (if not all) of us are going to learn a few things from
each other's submissions.  It is important to let us reuse this
knowledge in revised submissions, and this may require more than tweaks.

I am also unsure of what qualifies as a mere tweak and what does not,
and whether adding an extra password hashing scheme variation or extra
mode of operation (e.g., a scripting language friendly one to a
submission previously friendly to native code only) falls under "tweaks"
or not.  (Obviously, I am assuming that the test vectors will differ.
If they don't, it's a mere implementation change, which is not in any
way limited by PHC rules.)

The scripting language example is not an arbitrary one.  What I am
seeing so far is that all new designs being discussed so far focus on
native code only, so far.  Yet I think that given more time, having
received initial reviews/feedback, and having seen each other's
submissions, some of those same teams may come up with variations of
their schemes intended for scripting languages.  It just feels premature
to work on that yet.

The game does have to have rules, but not necessarily the exact rules
outlined in the provisional timeline so far.  If you feel that we need a
round where we'd shortlist a few finalists, then I think we potentially
need an extra round (before the shortlisting) for the knowledge reuse.

We might have a slightly better idea on whether the shortlisting round
is needed if we ask would-be submitters to announce their plans to
submit by/on the previously scheduled date of January 31 (so it won't be
a surprise to them that something is expected from them by then, and
it'd be a relief that less is expected and they have 2 more months for
the actual submissions).
