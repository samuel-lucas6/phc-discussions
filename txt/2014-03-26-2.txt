Now that my code seems stable-ish, I'm looking back into the math
behind pebbling proofs.  I see no error in Catena's, however, the
Catena paper also makes the following conjecture:

    T G^(L+1)/(S^L)

Where T is the number of pebble moves required, and L is lambda.

I think there is a slight error in the paper two equations before:

    G*(G/2S)^L = G^(L+1)/(2*S^L)

It should be 2^L, not 2.

You are right. Thanks a lot for pointing out this error.

We will fix it for the submission. :-)


I verified that Catena-2 can be pebbled with equal spaced pebbles in
rows 1 and 2 with S == G/4 with a recomputation penalty of 8, rather
than the predicted 16.

First of all, your observation is fully in tune with our Lemma 2.

Here we state that T >= G^3 / 128S^2. For S=G/4 we have
T >= G/8. With S= G/16 you should be closet to 16 then 8. :-)


The predicted penalty of 2^3 is more are rule of thumb it is asymptotic
and ignores constants. More precise would be the following formulation:
"penalty of about 2^L, depending on the choice of G and S."


BTW I had no time to take a look at SkinnyCat, yet. Currently, I am
super busy with other research and teaching stuff.


Best regards,
Christian
