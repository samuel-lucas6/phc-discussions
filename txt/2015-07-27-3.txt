A problem with Momentum as currently implemented is that it can be run with
reduced memory, enabling efficient GPU attacks.

Dave Andersen's latest remarks on his GPU code:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826901.msg11944049#msg11944049
You can ask him what he thinks is a faster implementation.

Fore reduced memory, you can find all collisions in 8MB,
using Cuckoo Cycle's algorithm for finding 2 cycles in bipartite graphs.

 I think we can get around
this problem simply by changing the parameters it uses.

If instead, we run with n == 26, and Hb's output also being 26 bits, then we
get around 2^26 collisions.

To me, that's a completely different beast.
I would no longer call that Momentum...
