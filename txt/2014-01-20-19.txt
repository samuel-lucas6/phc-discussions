Yes, it is indeed the same idea. I think we have to cite your work. :-)

I've just checked: even though RFC drafts eventually leading to RFC 5802
appeared in 1997 (which I was unaware of until 2012), their first
mention of slow hashing on the client appeared in the draft from 2007:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-newman-auth-scram-04

It's the Hi() function, which wasn't defined in the -03 draft (1998).

My first mention of slow hashing on the client is in a sci.crypt posting
from 1999:

https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sci.crypt/eh4GHsWKKbA

"performance:
	only the inner hash should preferably be slow (iterated)
	the server's performance is not affected by the inner hash"

I don't know if slow hashing off-load to the client was ever mentioned
before or not.

BTW, re-reading that tiny sci.crypt thread may be relevant to PHC.
