In terms of standardisation, there's not much there that's design-specific

I may point out that in the case of Makwa, the API necessarily has some
specificities, namely that it uses as parameter a big composite modulus,
and that the delegation feature (if you use it) must, by definition, use
a process that the API shall support.

(Makwa is a bit of a joker, at this stage of PHC. It has no memory cost,
only CPU, but it has parameters and functionalities that have no
equivalent in any other of the candidates.)

On the other hand, I have already defined (and implemented, and
documented) APIs for Makwa.
