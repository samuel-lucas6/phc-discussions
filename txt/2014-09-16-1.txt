Catena-3 with 128 MB of memory would need 2^21 64-byte SHA blocks,
so 2^23 compression function calls, i.e. 15mJ within 8/(316/65)=1.5
seconds. Our tradeoffs have computational penalty 3.75q for the
memory reduction by q, so, for instance, running it with 16 MB of
memory would require 30x more energy, or 450mJ within the same 1.5
seconds.

The memory will consume far larger. The 128-MB Catena-3
reads/writes 768 MB of data from/to RAM, and 1.5 GB in tradeoffs.
If we consider GDDR5, advocated by Bill, and scale it down to 300
MHz, it would at least consume 0.5W, so its energy consumption
would be 750mJ, and 94mJ for 16MB.

Therefore, the attacker will reduce his costs even if the memory is
reduced 8-fold. And we have not counted the retention energy yet,
as it will raise the tradeoff efficiency even more.


So, your chip-busting 16MiB on-chip ultra-wide, 30-port cache, from
which you will read 30X more data than I read from external GDDR5 in
the same time... will consume less than 0.1W?  I want some of that
magic memory!  And whatever you're smoking!

I just deleted all my power guestimates that show this is dream-land.
 If you can't figure this out on your own, I'm done talking about it.
