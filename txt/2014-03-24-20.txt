Keeping the best interest of the contest and the community in mind, I
have decided not to reply to your comments and risk having you write
another lengthy reply, preventing you from completing escrypt before the
deadline :) But I would like to thank you again for your comments. As
always, you are a great mentor.

I suppose the thing to do now is to write an optimized implementation
for both cpu and gpu, and just see how it performs. I will base my
decision for making any tweaks before the submission deadline on those
benchmarks. Any other tweaks I will probably save for after I submit due
to time constraints.

Jeremi
