This is one reason I like Blakerypt's session key idea.  Simply
hashing it with the password to create an intermediate derived key,
and then clearing the password, minimizes the attack surface against
the password, if I'm using your terminology correctly.  Is this the
kind of randomized blinding you're thinking of?  If so, I have to say
I agree with you.  I don't know of any other way to do it.  Is this
standard stuff?  Just because it's new to me doesn't mean it's new.
