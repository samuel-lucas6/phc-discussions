Subject: Multi-thread charts

IMO, these are the most important charts in the competition.  They show
real memory vs real runtime, for both low memory (< 128MiB) and high memory
(up to 4GiB).  This allows us to see real memory*time defense.

I used linear rather than logarithmic, because a factor of 2X matters, and
on a log-log chart, you can barely see a 2X difference.  This is why I had
to separate low and high memory use cases in separate charts.

I've attacked the raw data in a Libreoffice spread sheet in addition to
these JPEGs.
