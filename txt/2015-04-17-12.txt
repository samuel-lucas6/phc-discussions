I totally agree that Makwa is not completely comparable to bcrypt here,
because with bcrypt it is rather obvious that the CPU wins (though
people have tried, the GPU is still substantially lagging behind).
However it is still unclear whether GPU can be _more_ than merely
comparable to CPU, when counted in dollars. As long as the GPU is not
more efficient than the CPU, then Makwa still fulfills the required
property (i.e. defender's hardware is optimal).

Makwa's GPU defense is irrelevant to me, since I can simply compute Makwa
hashes with an FPGA, and it's ASIC defense is even worse.

All I would do is pipeline the heck out of the computation, doing something
like 2048 Makwa hashes in parallel.  My FPGA would crush any CPU.

This means that we should _always_ delegate Makwa hashes.  It is possible
to also use these Makwa hashing farms to secure a crypto-coin block chain,
making this a big win in a lot of ways, IMO.
