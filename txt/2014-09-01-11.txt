Subject: friendly warning about randomness tests


the diehard, testu01, dieharder, etc test suites are not cryptographic
tools. failing these tests is a clear break, and at least calls for
another postprocessing step (together with an assessment of actual
entropy content of the raw output). however, passing such tests mean
exactly nothing in crypto context.
