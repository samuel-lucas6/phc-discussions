Thus I would insist on hardcoding the number of rounds, hash function

choice.

I kind of agree, there can be too much choice. On the other hand, no 
designer is able to guess how much memory the user (or, more likely, the 
sysadmin) is willing to donate for password hashing, and how much time the 
user (or the sysadmin) is willing to spend for password hashing ... and 
even when the time is fixed, some tool is needed to conveniently fix the 
time parameter. This is what Catena-Axungia is for

   https://github.com/medsec/catena-axungia

... and yes, this is for Catena, but of course, something similar could 
(or, as I would claim, should!) be build for the other candidates as well.

So long
