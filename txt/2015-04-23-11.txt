- many code updates announced here (including Argon, Catena, MAKWA, etc)
- added parallel test
- I used newer machine for test (Lenovo x240 i7 CPU)
- Added pwxround=2 yescrypt to normalized test
- yescrypt now uses -opt version (not reference)
(I did not add it to other test these were meant to use defaults).
- All tested passwords are now randomly generated (/dev/urandom)
(previously were hardcoded in test program)

This is a great update, and I know how hard this is.  Thanks for doing it!

Two things would improve it, IMO.  First, improve contrast.  Being
massively color blind, I cannot read half of the lines on your charts.
Make sure that 2 of 3 of the RGB values are no higher than half (128), if
you can, and if you can only do that with one color, make it green or blue,
not red.

The other thing is that we're still missing what I feel is the most
important charge for your use case: full disk encryption.  There is simply
no reaon not to use the multi-core capability of the machine.  Most entries
do not have a parallelism parameter, but it is an absolutely critical
feature for FDE.

Could you add a real memory vs real runtime chart of only the optimized
versions of only the algorithms which expose a parallelism parameter, at 1
to 8 threads?

Thanks,
Bill
