I think it's the latter.

It is: for example m_cost=2 does not mean "2 megabytes", t_cost=100
does not (and cannot) mean "100 cpu cycles", etc.

t_cost and m_cost may (and will probably) accept different ranges of
values for different submissions. We did not want to impose a specific
range, as it would have restricted designers (although any countable
range can be mapped to [0;1], though with limited precision).

Oh, that's a different aspect from what you wrote in the previous few
paragraphs.  Yes, it is expected that the parameter values, except for
secrets, will be stored along with the hashes or with the encrypted
data (if the scheme is used as a KDF).  This is beyond scope of PHC,
although we may discuss it in here.

That's also my understanding.
