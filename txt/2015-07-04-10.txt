Sure, but this makes your 512 MB ROM sort of irrelevant for GPU attacks.
They can have that 512 MB in their GPU card's RAM, and will run almost as
fast (for a trivial enhancement of scrypt) or just as slow (for yescrypt
with pwxform).

I guess I am more concerned about ASICs.  People still enjoyed LiteCoin
mining with GPUs, but ASICs ruined the BitCoin party for a lot of people.

I _think_ the ROM defends well against an ASIC attack.  So would
mutiplication chains and the random small memory I/O operations.  However,
an ASIC attack will probably run at it's I/O bandwidth to memory.
