that is why i have asserts. they mainly serve documentation
purposes. however, it was not a requirement to provide self
documenting implementation. the submitted documentation should
serve as a reference. of course, self documenting code is nice to
have.


I saw that in your code and I appreciate it.  My Gambit review will be
easy because I considered my potential attacks last spring when I
reviewed your code and tested my pebbler against it.  I can do a up to
almost an 8-to-1 TMTO against it, IIRC, but then there seems to be a
solid wall against my pebbler.  You and I have different views about
the importance of an efficient hash function, but plug in Lyra2's
sponge into Gambit and my concerns over cache-bound efficiency mostly
go away.  I'll just re-list my notes from back then.  Gambit was one
of the easier entries for me to work with.
