Subject: Re: [PHC] Argon2 improvement thread

To all participants and the panel:

We are now seriously discussing major changes such as MAXFORM, and will
send a detailed reply on this issue tomorrow.

Regarding API. there is no objection to minor changes, but the hybrid (half
data-dependent, half data-independent) algorithm is a very delicate issue,
and we're still discussing it.

Merging Argon2d and Argon2i into one algorithm is a good idea to eliminate
code repetition, but we must ensure that a user does not consider them
equivalent.

Please do not hurry.

Best regards,
the Argon team

It would be good to hear from the Argon2 team about this concept.  I would
be happy to attempt to merge the two algorithms with a tri-state parameter,
as a fork on github.  Would that be worthwhile?

I'm glad to hear Alexander has benchmarks showing low impact when
integrating maxform.  That's great news.  Where is the code?  I prefer the
code to any other description.
