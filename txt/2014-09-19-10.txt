I look forward to reading about the Double-Butterfly Hashing.  I saw
something you might find interesting while trying to attack Makwa.  If
2 is a group generator modulo an odd prime, then multiplying to a
power of 2-inverse behaves a lot like a bit-reversal.

Any power-of-two long sequence, when multiplied by 2-iverse ^ bits in
sequence, evenly distributes (almost) the values throughout the
address space.  The most they can be off by is the length of the
sequence in bits.  However, unlike bit-reversal, if you apply the
operation again, you do not get back to where you started, and the
locations become difficult to predict.  It occurred to me that this
might be an interesting memory access pattern for a cache-timing
resistant algorithm.  I think you could still do your pebbling proofs
