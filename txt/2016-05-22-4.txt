Subject: Re: [PHC] Verbify "password hash"

Hi Scott,

"Perform password hashing" (yes, that's sidestepping the issue), or
otherwise "perform password based key derivation" (PBKDF2 is password based
key derivation function #2, and PBKDF can be thought of as a generic name
for a function performing password hashing).

I don't like key stretching.

   - First of all, a Key Based KDF such as HKDF can also perform key
   stretching.
   - Second, key stretching is a function that's part of the password
   hashing - it's not identical to it. HKDF for instance consists of two
   parts: HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand. The key stretching would be (part of)
   HKDF-Expand.
   - And finally, most people would not put a connection between key
   stretching and password hashing.

"Phash" is probably the best shorthand. But I'm not sure that there is a
need for one, nor that it will get any traction.

Regards,
Maarten

i think this came up earlier. my take: stretch. pbkdf is also good,
but long, and not accurate, as we don't always derive a key, we might
derive a verifier.

I like "stretch" as well. Especially since the phrase "key stretching"
is already used in this context, i.e.
