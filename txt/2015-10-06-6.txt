Curiously, for all compilers currently available on

i'm pretty sure that all the discussion about current compilers are
totally irrelevant if you plan to deliver standards for the upcoming
decades.

The discussion about current compilers is relevant in that even current
compilers already effectively disallow use of those broken constructions,
in case anyone still was not convinced.  So they work to prove a point.
