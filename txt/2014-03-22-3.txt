Subject: Re: [PHC] Transforming hash to different cost setting

Thanks Jeremi, but for the calculation of a password hash another
requirement is that we need sufficiently large memory and we constantly use
them throughout the calculation. Now if we try to update the previous
stored hash then next calculation will only depend on the stored hash value
and then how will it fulfil the memory requirement criteria for
transforming hash to different cost setting.


Thanks & Regards
Sweta Mishra

Simply put, it means the ability to take a password hash from the
database and upgrade it to a higher cost setting without knowing the
password. This way administrators can upgrade the security of an entire
database without hooking the login process to re-hash the password, or
forcing users to change their passwords.
