I opened a quick issue. It appears that SkinnyCat limits passwords to 255
bytes due to the length parameter being declared as a `uint8_t`. The
algorithm itself seems to support longer passwords as everywhere else it is
used internally other than the 2 function headers is represented by a
`unit32_t` field. So not sure if this is intentional or not, nor if it is an
issue or not. Just pointing out an observation.

Hi, Anthony.  This is intentional.  The full TwoCats algorithm allows
password, data, and salt lengths up to 2^30 bytes each, but to do
this, I need to use the Init/Update/Final APIs to all of the supported
cryptographic hash functions.  In SkinnyCat, by limiting the password
and salt to a combined 512 bytes, I can allocate an array on the stack
without even calling malloc, concatenate all the input data there, and
make a simple call to the hashing API on one line.

With this scheme, adding a new hash function, so long as it outputs
256 bits, requires just adding a new enumerated type value, and two
lines in a switch statement.  In comparison, TwoCats has an object
oriented wrapper class to support hash functions.  It's more powerful,
but it adds complexity.

Thanks for taking a look.  There are probably goobers in there.  This
code did not exist 30 hours ago, and I've worked on it for most of
those hours.  Sleep deprivation has to have had an impact.
