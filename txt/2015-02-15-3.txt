With *your* *recommended* sets of parameters, CubeHash was absurdly slow.

I understand, what the NIST saw in CubeHash, and I actually agree with 
the decision to keep CubeHash in the secon round of SHA-3. CubeHash was a 
cool design!

BTW, it is a pity that you preferred a formal version (meeting the tweaked 
security requirements, but absurdly slow) and a recommended version (fast 
enough, but badly failing even the tweaked security requirements), rather 
than submitting a proper tweak that did address the concerns raised by the 
NIST in the first-round report.

[...] If you're going to accuse NIST of ignoring its own rules then you 
should focus on the rules that they actually published, not the rules 
that you wish they had published instead.

The initial rules required approximately 2^512. Later, the rule was 
tweaked to accept 2^480 or more as an approximation for 2^512.

I am sure you can find plenty of lawyers who will credibly argue that 
2^480 is a reasonable approximation of 2^512. But good luck with finding 
plenty of scientists who agree with calling that an "approximation". ;-)

In any case, the story of CubeHash is off-topic for this list, so I won't 
discuss it any more, here. I am willing to discuss my ideas for a CubeHash 
tweak with you, the next time we meet in person. ;-)

So long
