I have no way to influence this, I just hope winners may be announced at #passwords15 in Las Vegas on August 4-5, and then see papers related to the winners appear at Passwords 2015 in Cambridge, dec 7-9.

Best regards,
Per Thorsheim

password-hashing.net says phc winners will 
be announced on q2 2015. now it's q3 2015 
and no announcement. if the phc panel 
decides to postpone it, shouldn't that be 
informed too, at least here? thank you.
