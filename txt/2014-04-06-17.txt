Pufferfish has a minor bug in api.c.  I'm not 100% I got the fix
right, but I am 100% sure this is a bug.  On line 135, memmove is
calling strlen(hash) to determine how much data to copy.  It seems
like it should use strlen instead, assuming Pufferfish supports
variable out length.  Here's the diff after I made this change:

No, this is incorrect. The `hash' variable in this context is not the
raw hash value, it is the encoded hash plus the hash identifier and
encoded salt string.
