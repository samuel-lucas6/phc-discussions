Subject: Re: [PHC] not bossy

We're working on finalizing our list of speakers and talks with
abstracts, to appear on passwordscon.org soon.

On my list of PHC/related talks I can list these for you:

Thomas Pornin
Passwords hashing delegation: how to get clients to work for you

Dmitry Khovratovich, Alex Biryukov & Johann Großschädl
Tradeoff cryptanalysis of password hashing schemes

Christian Rechberger
Using cryptanalysis to speed-up password cracking

Steve 'Sc00bz' Thomas
Bitslice DES with LOP3.LUT

Marsh Ray, Greg Zaverucha
What Microsoft would like from the Password Hashing Competition


We have some other names on our list as well, currently awaiting final
confirmation before announcing them.

Our coop and co-lo with BSides we'll have a much more professional A/V
setup than previous years, with yours truly and a single consumer
videocamera trying to act like a semipro, with various results. This
year we'll hopefylly have Adrian Crenshaw (@irongeek_adc) to
professional recording and uploading to that 7-letter video sharing
site. :-)

Not sure about live-streaming yet, I doubt it at the moment.

Best regards,
Per

In the meantime, there are expected to be some presentations at Passwords14 (Aug 5-6) that are directly relevant to PHC. It was a great conference last year and I encourage anyone interested in the topic to attend if able.

Last year the slides were up quickly and the video was up on a well-known video sharing site within a few days.

Per, Jeremi:

I assume current list of talks and speakers will be up in text form at some point?

Out of curiosity, does the new partnership with BSides have any implications for the AV production or the possibility of live-streaming?

We're currently preparing to decide on the list of finalists, and we want to be careful about it, so don't expect to see the result until early autumn or so.

Input and observations on the candidates are of course still very welcome.
