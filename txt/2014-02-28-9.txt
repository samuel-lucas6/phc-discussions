Subject: Re: [PHC] "Predictable" vs "pseudorandom" KDFs

Reminds me of the discussion that lead to "password hashing schemes"
and some of its exotic proposals.

I'd rather settle for something self-contained as "cache-timing
resistant" (we could then have a debate regarding whether "resistant"
or "resilient" is the most suitable adjective; I'd go for the former).

I had to look up bike shedding.  This is definitely a bike shedding opportunity.

I could get behind "silent" and "noisy".  That's better than my

How about "stealthy" and "noisy"?  Stealthy sounds cooler.  Definitely
a bike shed moment...
