one more question/observation: i don't understand the reason for 
gambit's basic crypto being "claimed" as opposed to "explored",
since it inherits these properties from the underlying sponge, in
the proposed instance, keccak. what other exploration is needed?


As you know, I'm not a fan of all of your ideas, but the basic
security of your entry is simply not in doubt.  Anyone who reads your
code can clearly see you have one of the most secure entries in terms
of basic crypto.  It may not be fast in it's current form, but it
certainly gets "basic crypto" right more than Argon, which writes the
password to memory and leaves it there for a long time!
