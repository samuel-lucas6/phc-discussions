I'd prefer a name for escrypt that would derive from and hint to its
qualities, not refer to who's behind it.  A reference and homage to
scrypt would be appropriate, though.  JtR is not terribly relevant.

BTW, speaking of naming escrypt based on who's behind it, I briefly
thought of names like owcrypt and wowcrypt (such very appropriate in the
year of dogecoin), referring to Openwall, but like I said I dislike this
approach.  I think the name should be "vendor-neutral".
