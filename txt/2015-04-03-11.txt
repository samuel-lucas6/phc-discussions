I'm not an expert in cryptocurrency issues, but from what I heard so far
the maximum time per hash computation is a lot lower, as needed to allow
for fast verification of transactions.  This is what keeps them at
around 2 MB currently.  Maybe an expert would chime in.

The things are a bit different. Transactions are hashed and
ECC-signed, and indeed they must be verified fast. Still, an ECC
signature check takes about 1/1000-th of a second, and the current
rate of 700 transaction per block means that the total verification
takes almost a second already.

However, mining is different, you do not hash transactions there, you
just hash a singe nonce. Spending 1 second for block hashing means
that the total block verification would take 2 seconds instead of
current 1. Not a big deal, blocks appear every 10 minutes (in Bitcoin)
anyway.
