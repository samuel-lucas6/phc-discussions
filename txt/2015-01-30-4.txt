Substantial changes to a submission would complicate the work of the
panel: imagine that 2 weeks before announcing the decision, a
candidate adds new features, drop some others, etc.

What is of course acceptable are editorial changes to the document,
new or improved implementations.

After the tweaks deadline, what (if any) changes would still be allowed?

Further polishing of the specification document and the reference
implementation, without a change of what hashes are computed for any of
the valid inputs?

Removal of optional features (extra modes of operation that are not
exposed via the PHS() API)?

Addition of optional features (ditto)?

Changes to optional features (ditto), possibly changing what hashes are
computed for some non-PHS() inputs/settings (thus, not affecting the PHC
subset of the test vectors, but affecting some others)?

Updates of existing optimized implementations (previously included in
the submission package along with the reference implementation)?

Addition of extra implementations?  Or should they stay outside of PHC,
and if so would they be referenced from the PHC website or wiki at all?
