Sorry, perhaps I should rewrite my example in Python in a style more similar to the other submissions?

Not my call, whatever others on the list like is fine with me. Just consider the audience, and you can do that as well (or probably better than) I. My understanding was that we were just discussing ideas, not actual submissions (which will need an implementation in C). Maybe pseudocode will work for this. A lot of folks seem to like Python too.

I didn't have much trouble reading Trevor Perrin's Python, but I note that it didn't *actually* seem to be parallelizing over multiple threads. The Ruby looked like it would run in parallel, except that the normal interpreter doesn't do that. Go figure!
