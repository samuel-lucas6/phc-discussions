Yesterday, I had some fun benchmarking Lyra2, TwoCats, and Yescrypt.
 Are there any other authors who would like their algorithms
benchmarked?  I'd be happy to start tabulating data on all the entries
that are ready for benchmarking.  After yesterday's hack-fest, I don't
feel simply running the PHS routines without the involvement of the
author is likely to generate useful data, so I'm only going to do
benchmarking the authors request for now.

Feel free to include EARWORM in your benchmarks. You seem to have
studied it enough that I trust you to get it right. Unfortunately, I
won't be available to assist for a while. My life recently has been
completely consumed by my day job, and next week I'm running away to the
Yukon to get as far away from an internet connection as possible.
