Looking at the Lyra2 code again, I see that rowa is XOR-ed with a 64-bit
rotation of the 768-bit state.  I did not model this.  One way to deal with
it is to double the graph size, since two nodes are written at each step
rather than one.  As with Gambit, I'm not sure exactly what to make of the
XOR vs a stronger function.  Knowing the value of the XOR-ed node, and one
input tells me the other, and I'm sure that can be used to improve a
pebbling attack, but I haven't any clue how to enhance the algorithm to
take good advantage of this.

However, I am not a fan of the backwards counting edge destination.  There
are several alternatives that perform well.
