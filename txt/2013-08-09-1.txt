You may be right, but I can imagine counter-examples:

 * File or disk encryption, where the salt is in the header.

 * An attacker who can read a site's password database or some of its
hashes, but doesn't have full control of the system.

To such a "known-salt" attacker, the memory-access pattern becomes
essentially a new password hash which he can try to crack by
simulating the memory access of candidate guesses.

This might give a known-salt side-channel attacker a faster
alternative to cracking a full password hash.
