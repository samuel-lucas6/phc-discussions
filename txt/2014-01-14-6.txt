Looks like 500 MiB DDR3 is currently $4.22 retail. This doesn't
sound cost-prohibitive

please note that the proposed hypothetical machine consists of 2^32
units. if you want to add $4 memory to all of them, we are talking
about 16bn dollars + a new power plant. granted, you work for MS, so
you can imagine that :) but not many others can.
