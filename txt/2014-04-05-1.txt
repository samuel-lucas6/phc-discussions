EARWORM is well differentiated from yescript, IMO.  It is a slimmer
simpler special purpose tool.  The reliance on AESENC instructions and
the super fast read-only hashing sets it apart.

Actually the super fast hashing is both my favorite feature of
EARWORM, and the feature that I hate most.  I can't believe a hashing
algorithm called EARWORM hashes at almost twice my bandwidth.  You're
basically running at memmove speed!
