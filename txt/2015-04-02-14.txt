In actual usage, those extra parameters may in fact be tuned to match specific use cases better.

Rijndael with a block size of 256 bits would fit many applications better than AES, too. But the world has generally agreed with NIST that having fewer choices makes a better standard than being perfectly flexible to fit all situations.

I feel tuning the PHC parameters for your hardware should be more like, say, buying a shirt and pants off the rack than getting a custom-tailored suit with half a dozen measurements.
