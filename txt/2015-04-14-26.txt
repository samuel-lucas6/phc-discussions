Subject: Re: [PHC] updated report of POMELO

Dear Axel,

The second part of the output of POMELO' is used as the key.

A reference code of POMELO-KDF and its test vector are attached to this
email.   The function name is PHSKDF,  the API is similar to that of PHS,
except that "key" is used to replace "out", "keylen" is used to replace
"outlen".

I will upload the POMELO-KDF code and the test vector to the following
webpage a few hrs later:
    http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/wuhj/research/pomelo/

Best Regards,
hongjun

    Simply speaking, POMELO is iterated in POMELO-KDF to generate a
key with arbitrary length (in case if a very long key is needed).

For me it's not quite clear, which part of Pomelo' output should be used
for the key if the required key size is not a multiple of 128.
Code or test vectors would be helpful even regardless of the reference
code.
