Subject: Re: [PHC] Argon2 v1.0 versus v1.2

The 1.2 version of the document was shared on this list but the Argon
submission package was not updated, that's why the version on
https://password-hashing.net/candidates.html hasn't been updated.

I know updated the Argon (and Argon2) submission from v2 to v3, linking to
the Argon2 1.2 document. This is a bit messy and we should eventually have
a single version numbering.

Thus neither v1.0 nor v1.2 is the final version, but v1.2 is closer to
it and whatever security analysis you are going to make probably should
target v1.2 first.

Great—that’s good to know. Thanks Dmitry, Bill, and Samuel for the quick
