there is no such thing as sorta cache timing resistant. it either is

OK, then all the hybrid designs are *not* cache timing resistant.  However,
they all happen to be better at *defending the password* than any of the
cache-timing resistant algorithms, even when the attacker has cache-timing
data.  What should we call algorithms that provide better cache-timing
password defense than cache-timing resistant algorithms?
