Sorry for resurrecting an earlier incarnation of this thread but wanted
to
pose the question: are we actually worried about people using ASICs for
password cracking?

It depends.  For military strength security, I have to say yes, and
I'm hoping the PHC winner cares about that case.  I'd say it is very
likely that China has an ASIC based password cracking center.  For
most people, likely even including large companies like Apple and
Target, probably not.

​The comparative number of deployed instances requiring "military strength"
security - however that is defined - is likely to be very small compared to
run-of-the-mill deployments.  My personal feelings are that the first
priority is trying to optimize for the most common uses and assume the
parameters can be ramped-up for the paranoid.​

Yes.  I notice no one replies to threads where I get specific about
that, so I'm going to stop doing that.

​Apologies if I've missed these items, I've not had the time to read
through every message on this list.

If the NSA, GCHQ, et al. are targeting someone, do they not already have

I hope they aren't wasting my tax dollars, but if the NSA has
legitimate needs for cracking passwords that other's can't, then they
would be doing a very poor job without an ASIC based cracking center.

​The point is that for the vast majority of use-cases, worrying about the
NSA/GCHQ is pointless -- it's a lost-cause and the users in those
situations don't tend to care.  What they do care about is if a load of
their accounts are compromised just because one online service they use is
hacked.

Another reason to focus on ASICs is that you defend against all
architectures when you defend against ASICs.  Commercial chips with
many CPU cores (say 1024 like my example) capable of hashing Bcrypt as
fast per core as my Intel Core i7 may be in our near future.  With
that event, Bcrypt security will drop tremendously.  Scrypt will fare
far better.

​I agree that massively scalar CPUs are on the horizon (fairly sure I'd
read an article a few years back about Intel doing this?).  ​It does
somewhat throw a spanner in the works in terms of current assumptions
though: if general purpose CPUs end up having thousands of cores, it makes
more sense to hammer compute tasks rather than memory.

I thought bcrypt was secure(ish) against GPUs but not ASICs?

Given a chance to develop a new PHS, I would hope solutions will be

without giving up on any of them.

​In an ideal world, yes.  However, I'm getting the distinct impression that
to defend against ASICs imposes utterly unrealistic resource requirements
on the defender, to the extent that it would hinder adoption of the PHS.​
 Is it not worth specifying default parameters at a more realistic level
and explicitly stating the risks?  (with the option for higher security by
increasing parameters in cases when it's required)
