Obviously, I'm all for mechanical tests.  In case it makes it easier
for everyone, I just created a git repo on github for mechanical
testing of PHC entries.  It's at:

https://github.com/waywardgeek/phc-candidates

If anyone would like to be added as a collaborator, just send me an
email at waywardgeek@...il.com
