if the accusation is lack of understanding (which you indeed
demonstrated, though it was a slight misstep in my view)

At what point did I demonstrate a lack of understanding / make a slight
misstep?


demonstrating understanding is a better defense than questioning the
accuser's pedigree and bragging about yours.

I "demonstrated my understanding" multiple times. And I did not "brag"
about my pedigree, I simply stated a fact. Had I rattled off a list of
accomplishments and accolades, that would indeed have been bragging. But
I didn't. "I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader."


especially if easy to
find information on the internet does not put you in the position of
an expert, so it remains a claim and nothing more.

Uh, what? What easy to find information on the Internet are you
referring to?
