Subject: Argon2 using memset still

g++ has a habit of optimizing calls to memset away.  I doubt that Argon2
succeed in it's attempts to clear memory.  I copied this function from
Blake2:

/* prevents compiler optimizing out memset() */
static inline void secure_zero_memory( void *v, size_t n )
{
  volatile uint8_t *p = ( volatile uint8_t * )v;
  while( n-- ) *p++ = 0;
}
