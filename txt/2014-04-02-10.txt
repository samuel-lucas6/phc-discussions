You are correct, there are 11 functions in the definitions and the
number has been reduced to 10 on purpose.

As with the rest of the FP operations, the 1/x interval was suggested
late and is the first "more complex" FP operation. I did not find the
time to verify that the define is working as intended and wanted to
check the assembly output first, so I reduced the PHS_F_COUNT number
to ignore it.

We will change this of course when we revise the floating point usage
(following IEEE) and update the functions.

Cheers,
Ralf

PHS_F_COUNT defined as 10 but there are 11 non-dummy functions (F00
to F10).

Is PHS_F_COUNT suppose to be 11 or is F10 not suppose to be used?
