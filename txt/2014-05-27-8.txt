Subject: Argon: presentation

Hi all,

to further explain the design rationale and strengths of Argon, we have
prepared a presentation that is available at
https://www.cryptolux.org/images/8/80/Argon-slides.pdf . It does not
require the reader to be familiar with the reference guide, though it
refers to the guide for the details.

We welcome all comments, questions, and suggestions to include/clarify some
particular points in the design and analysis.


-- 
Best regards,
Dmitry Khovratovich
