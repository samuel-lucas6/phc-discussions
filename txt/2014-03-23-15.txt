I believe we had previously discussed and agreed upon a period after the
initial review where submissions could be tweaked. I see no reason why
major tweaks within reason would be a problem. If your major tweaks
result in a dramatically different algorithm, then I think that would be
a problem :) But reasonable and organic enhancements should be fine as
long as the overall shape of the algorithm does not change.
