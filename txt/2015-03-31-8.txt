Subject: PHC website edit

For selecting the winners, the PHC panel agreed that panel members who
submitted could discuss their submission, and attempt to objectively
assess it against other submissions. For the sake of transparency, the
said discussions will be made public after the selection.

The PHC website has been revised accordingly, removing the statement
"however they [panel members] will not participate in discussions
regarding their own submission" from
https://password-hashing.net/index.html.
