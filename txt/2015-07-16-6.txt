Sounds plausible to me, and probably better than what the current crop of

In this design, is a 32 GiB ROM really needed? On the one hand, this

Alexander suggested 32 GiB as a way to avoid bot-nets.  I think he has a
point.  However, if we are not trying to defend against bot-nets, then 1-4
GiB would probably be better.
