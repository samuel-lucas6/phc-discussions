It's a fixed pattern, 

well, it has to be a fixed pattern, since i chose to follow the principle of no branching or indexing on secret. the only other option would be a pattern based on the salt, but it makes little difference if the attacker attacks a single password at a time.

so the "save every sqrt(n)th" value technique
which reduces cost for the attacker to n^{3/2} 

i would like to familiarize myself a little better with that argument. do you have any link how to derive that? my math is a little rusty, and i keep getting no gain. also, what is the "cost" in this calculation? steps * memory?

For small f (i.e. f<<sqrt(m))

this never happens, f is either m-1 or something like 100m/101. m/2 worst case. for keccak, f would be much closer to m than m/2.
