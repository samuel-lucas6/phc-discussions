Heya,

you are correct, it uses the prefix as a prefix to the state buffer
and hashes the whole prefixed buffer to derive more than 64 bytes of
output (if requested).
I know that it is unnecessary to call phs_store_derived_state(), e.g.,
in the case that you request 128 bytes, you will compute a lot of
SHA512 results you do not need.

But as the call for submissions stated that the code should not be
optimized for efficiency but be readable, I thought to emphasis that
it uses the same code as before, so the reader does not need to
analyze the code twice.

Sorry if this was rather confusing than helpful.

Cheers,
Ralf

No, it is doing SHA512(LITTLE_ENDIAN_32(prefix) || state) because: 
ctx->stateprefix = ((uint32_t*) ctx->state) - 1 and it is given a
length of "ctx->state_bytes + sizeof(uint32_t)"

I know it looks confusing I had problems too. This is also very 
inefficient the call to phs_store_derived_state() fills the whole 
state with SHA512s.
