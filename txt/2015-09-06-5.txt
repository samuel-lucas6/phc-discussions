What CPU exactly are you testing on? That one has 2.1 GHz. We detected quite big difference in cycle/byte performance on similar CPU with different frequencies.

Just saw this:

Looks like a ton of good effort by a lot of good people, but there's a table claiming TwoCats generates only 1.26 bytes/cycle on a Haswell CPU compared to some lame speed by their algorithm.  Huh?

I just measured it on a similar CPU at 0.46 cycles/byte   There are trade-offs,, and speed isn't everything.  It just happens to be fun :)  Sorry, but the authors here made a mistake.

I guess I can't get mad about other peoples mistakes.... that would be seriously hypocritical.
