If Alexander proposed to integrate his PWXFORM (I don't know what MAXFORM
is), then I would be for it.  This would satisfy my request for improved
GPU resistance, and also my request for multiplication-chain computation
time hardening.

MAXFORM is the scalar equivalent to (and subset of) pwxform.  It's
neither parallel, nor wide, but is otherwise the same.

As to why I call it MAXFORM:

1. MAX stands for multiply-add-XOR (much like ARX is add-rotate-XOR).

2. MAX doubles as referring to the latency of one round being
max(multiply, lookup).

3. XFORM is short for transformation.
