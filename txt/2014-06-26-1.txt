So while it could be a good idea in terms of bits mixing, I think it is
not good enough to implement with individual instructions (until a CPU
gets a single instruction like this, with same latency as MUL alone).

I wonder if it'd be feasible to piggyback on the push for GCM and use CLMUL 
and its (prospective?) siblings on other architectures.

I thought of that, but for a different purpose: to buy some unfriendliness
to CPU/GPU architectures that don't yet have CLMUL (especially GPUs).
I think AES-NI and PSHUFB/VPPERM might be better for that purpose,
although we could add CLMUL to the mix too. %-)

As to ASICs, I agree with Thomas about CLMUL.

For yescrypt, I felt that it's preferable to be friendly to those CPUs
that don't have CLMUL yet, and to have greater ASIC resistance.  Hence
no CLMUL there.
