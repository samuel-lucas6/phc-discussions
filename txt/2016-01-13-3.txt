I like the idea of XORing over memory for Argon2i.  Both Lyra2 and Gambit did this.


and for a reason!

in http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/1386 i wrote:

"if you overwrite, the slot becomes unused for a while. i mean, once
it has been read, and until it gets a new value, it just sits there
unused. at any point in time, a certain fraction of the memory (and a
quite huge fraction) is in this idle state. if you cleverly reuse
memory slots, you can run the algorithm with smaller memory footprint.
i prevent this by never discarding any value."
