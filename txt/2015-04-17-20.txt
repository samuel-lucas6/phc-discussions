I think it would help this community if you try applying your attack to
scrypt proper.  Initially for storage of just the last sub-blocks (in
addition to some full blocks), and then (after publishing your initial
results) also for storage of arbitrary sub-blocks.  Try to identify
which ones and how many are optimal to store.  Perhaps the "how many"
will vary depending on the higher-level TMTO factor that you apply, so
perhaps the SMix-level and BlockMix-level TMTO factors would need to be
optimized together.

The scrypt paper is very careful when it talks about a "constant factor"
without specifying any upper bound on it, so it won't exactly be a break
of scrypt if you show that this constant factor is higher than is
possible with an SMix-level attack alone.  But it will be a significant
new result.

Actually, if you show that the reduction of memory-time product for
scrypt is a function of r and has no constant upper bound, then this may
be a (theoretical) break of scrypt.  You could start by considering
extreme cases such as N=2 and high r, then N=4 and high r, and then
generalize this to any N and r, and see what happens for sane r.

I expect that scrypt at high r might in fact be broken in this sense.
