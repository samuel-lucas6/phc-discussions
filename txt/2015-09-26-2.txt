char *encode64_uint32(char *dst, size_t dstlen, uint32_t src);

encode64_uint32() encodes the number in src into the string pointed to
by dst, and returns a pointer to right after the encoded number.

decode64_uint32() decodes the number in the string src into dst, and
returns a pointer to right after the encoded number.

The intent is that we can easily call these functions multiple times in
a row, to encode/decode multiple numbers.

As you can see, the encoding/decoding functions are quite simple.

Attached is a slightly shorter version: I removed the "base" variable,
and instead update src or *dst (when encoding or decoding) directly.
Perhaps this can be shortened further, but this wouldn't necessarily
make it simpler.
