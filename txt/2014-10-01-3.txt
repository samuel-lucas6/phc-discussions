OK, it is rather a matter of semantics then :)

OTOH, I may be shooting myself in the foot here, but I'm not sure the
attack you describe is actually better than what we (partially)
describe. More precisely (and I may very well have misunderstood
something from your slides): in Lemma 1, we describe an attack with no
penalty during the Setup phase when the memory usage is 1/2, while in
your case the attack penalty is described as "1.5" in (which I assume
means "50% slower") in slide 48. Did I miss something?

For the Wandering phase, we indeed consider a scenario with 50% of the
memory usage to show how badly the strategy being discussed ("store
ahead") scales. Now that I think about it, that was misleading, since it
was never intended as a through analysis for such 50% memory usage.
Anyhow, that was our fault, so you do have the right to say that your
attack is better than what we provided in the documentation.

Anyway, again: that was a great analysis and we are taking those
considerations into account in our own trade-off discussion. I believe
it should be placed into a context were the speed is also taken into
account, though, since if the user is willing to spend ~3.5 seconds
doing the password hashing (the time obtained by Bill in his benchmarks
for Argon), for example, then he/she would prefer using T around 5,
which, by design, leads to a much higher TMTO defense.

BR,

Marcos.

Hi Marcos,

thank you for the response!

my understanding was that page 22 and Section 5.1.3 in
https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/Lyra2-v1.pdf contain some
analysis of using less memory than intended. In particular, you describe
how to use 1/2 of memory in the Setup phase (page 22) and in the Wandering
phase (page 25).

Maybe wording "claims" was too strong in my document, it would be better to
say that there exist third-party results more efficient than the original
analysis.

I did not look into tweaks intentionally, I'd prefer to wait till they are
approved by the committee.

Best regards,
Dmitry
