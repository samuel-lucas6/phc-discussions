My machine was acting up and giving me sub-optimal runtimes, so I rebooted
and now it's back to normal.  With r=32, the correct runtime is:

PHC!!
time phs-yescrypt 0 16
Allocating 2147504128 bytes

2f c7 c0 a0 1b 0c 6b 82
61 4d 6b c0 02 cb 16 d7
6c 40 2b 60 2b 9b 23 8c
d2 32 7c a3 56 b4 ab 25      32 (octets)


real    0m0.600s
user    0m0.510s
sys     0m0.090s

So, I need to revise my Yescript numbers yet again:

Yescrypt: Salsa20/2, 1 PWXFORM round, r=32
Peak memory/second: 3.33 GiB/s
Average memory/second: 2.08 GiB/s
Memory bandwidth: 8.89 GiB/s

So now the average memory cost lead for TwoCats is only 7.2%.  I think I'll
propose that we call it a draw.
