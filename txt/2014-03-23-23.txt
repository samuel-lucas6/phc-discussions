Solar Designer (at Sunday, March 23, 2014, 4:03:55 PM):
I think having an implementation right away is very important.  It shows
that the algorithm actually exists.

but i'm quite sure there are other ways to convince you about it, like
a good and easy to read pseudocode.

Test vectors could be postponed, yes, but they are relatively quick to
produce,

they are also notoriously hard to test and debug. having a bug in a
reference implementation is ... not so good.

Test vectors are a trivial technicality,
[...]
Implementation is not as trivial, but is important to have right away.

see the contradiction?

I can implement that in a weekend (in
fact, I readily have implementations of each past revision of escrypt)

just like i did. but without checking every single corner case, down
to each and every operations on byte level, considering all the
different possible architectures, compilers and the like, i would not
call that a reference implementation, and whatever it produces, i
would not call test vectors.
