Subject: yescrypt in PHP and Ruby

Hi,

Taylor Hornby (@DefuseSec) is working on implementing yescrypt in
several languages, and so far has produced initial implementations in
PHP and Ruby:

https://github.com/defuse/yescrypt

These are not pretty and they are not fast.  They also highlight
limitations of those languages as it relates to dealing with 64-bit
integers.

Yet these implementations help improve the confidence there are no C
artifacts affecting the test vectors, etc.  No such surprises so far.

This project also helps identify omissions in the current yescrypt
spec, and will hopefully result in a comprehensive and cleaner spec.

Alexander
