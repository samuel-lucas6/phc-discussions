Subject: integer multiply was not always constant-time

BTW, let's not forget that even MUL/IMUL were not constant time on 486
and prior (and it's similar on similarly old non-x86 archs).  So if we
care about being timing-safe even on CPUs this old, we should probably
avoid multiplication in the portion where we avoid cache timing leaks.
