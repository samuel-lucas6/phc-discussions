Adding an efficiently-invertible group automorphism doesn't make the

the discrete log problem is easy. If I have your public key X =
Finv(F(x)*F(g)) where x is your private key, then I compute F(X) =
F(Finv(F(x)*F(g))) = F(x)*F(g), use Euclid's algorithm to solve for
F(x), then recover your private key by computing Finv(F(x)) = x.

You are 100% right.  Making the automorphism impractical or impossible to
compute seems to be the key.
