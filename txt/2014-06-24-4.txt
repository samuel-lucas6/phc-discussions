IIRC, a hurdle was that Solaris of the time would clobber high 32 bits

64-bit, but userland 32-bit)

It was the other way round: the kernel was 32-bit, and unaware that
the userland was doing things with the high halves of the 64-bit
registers (actually, the kernel was unaware that the registers were
longer than 32 bits).

Solaris 7, released in November 1998, was 64-bit aware and removed this
limitation. The DES-frenzy at distributed.net reached its end on January
1999 (the DES-III challenge) so the 64-bit Solaris did not have enough
time to percolate before people lost interest in bitslice DES
optimization.


While arriving at the absolute lowest gate count (and having any sort
of certainty of that) is already intractable for DES S-boxes even with
few gate types, an interesting question is whether we likely get
closer or stay farther away from that holy grail in practice when we
have more gate types.

As far as I know, Kwan's work for almost entirely manual (that's what
he told me, at least) so he cannot easily do it again under other
conditions.

Apart from UltraSPARC, a number of other processors have opcodes which
go beyond the elementary operations corresponding to C operators. For
instance, Alpha offered the classic NOT, AND, OR and XOR, but also
ANDNOT, ORNOT and XORNOT.
