AIUI, pixman has support for runtime detection of that sort (xorg
license).

Several of the audio/video codec libs should, too.

The vector sets provide a significant speed advantage for several crypto
routines.  As an example, IIRC, I recorded a speedup of 6x for poly1305
between the optimized C and avx2 versions.  And chacha20 saw about 4x.
