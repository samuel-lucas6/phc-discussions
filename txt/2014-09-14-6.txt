I think reducing the number of Blowfish rounds defeats the point
of using battcrypt anyway.  battcrypt is primarily to be
implemented using a scripting language's calls to a native
implementation of Blowfish, so it usually won't be able to tweak
the Blowfish rounds count.

Ah, I see.  That is a blow against PufferFish then, isn't it?
PufferFish upgraded the hashing to 64-bit, which will be incompatible
with PHP's BlowFish.

No, Pufferfish doesn't claim to be scripting language-friendly. If one
were to integrate Pufferfish into PHP, it would best be accomplished
with an extension or patch. It's not like bcrypt in PHP is implemented
in native PHP.
