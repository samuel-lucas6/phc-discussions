Ideally, PHC should concentrate on the cryptographic qualities of the
candidates, using code made for research, not for production.
Production-ready implementations will come later on, for the winner(s),
and these will include a simplified string-based API. Developers at
large will cautiously wait for these implementations to emerge, and use
them.

FTR, I share that point of view: PHC is mainly a competition for an
algorithm, not for a production-ready piece of software. The
possibility of user-friendly interfaces will be taken in consideration
when selecting the winner(s). Regarding string-based APIs, we expect
string formatting/encoding/packing components to be largely agnostic
of the underlying hash algorithm.
