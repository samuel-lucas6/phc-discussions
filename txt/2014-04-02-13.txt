Hi all,

As far as can I see, it is more a specification/implementation issue,
but maybe I don't see everything that is to be seen. E.g. I don't follow
the IRC channel (maybe I should ?).

I just want to briefly stress that there is a difference between a
"cryptanalysis" and a "problem with portability/the specification",
where the comments for AntCrypt fall in the latter category (as far as
I'm aware of).

Of course I'm sensitive (as I'm one of the authors of AntCrypt), but in
general precise communication is important for a scientific discussion.

All the best,
Markus
