Subject: Updated tests document

Hello,

I updated PHC candidates test output for the previously discussed tests

  https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/phc_round2.pdf

- added "normalized" test from tables in http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2550
- fixed Lyra2 to us just one thread
- added memory/time combined chart
- added Argon2 git versions (just for comparison)
- added more functions to KDF example

Otherwise it is kept in the same format.

I hope it is at least somehow useful (despite I know that this output is quite limited).

Thanks,
Milan

It would be very nice to test also parallel attribute but then functions should
export some unified interface.
If it is not too late, maybe addinng m_parallel to PHS() as a tweak...
