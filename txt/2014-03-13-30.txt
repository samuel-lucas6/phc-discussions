I think the NSA would prefer that we continue using Bcrypt and not
switch to Scrypt.  Let's assume they have liquid nitrogen cooled ASICs
with 1024 Bcrypt hashing cores running say 2X faster than the fastest
CPU on each core.  If I understand correctly, Bcrypt only requires
4KiB of memory, so integrating 1024 of them is not unreasonable.  Per
board, let's guess they have 64 chips, and maybe 1024 boards, for a
factor of 134 million-to-1 compute power vs a high-end PC.

Bcrypt is safe against all those GPU crackers who don't have the money
to build what the NSA can, so bcrypt does a good job protecting the
public, while allowing government sized organizations the ability to
crack passwords far more effectively.  I think that's the NSA's
prefered sweet spot for the public.

​Sorry for resurrecting an earlier incarnation of this thread but wanted to
pose the question: are we actually worried about people using ASICs for
password cracking?​

Have ASICs been used for password cracking to date?

​If the NSA, GCHQ, et al. are targeting someone, do they not already have
numerous measures to compromise hosts other than password cracking?
