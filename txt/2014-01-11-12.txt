Actually, we had two Google Summer of Code projects last year,
implementing bcrypt and Litecoin (scrypt at 128 KB) on Epiphany.
We got reasonably good performance numbers for bcrypt.  For E64, they're
on par with common CPUs and GPUs, but at much lower energy consumption:

Sweet.

Maybe, although I'd be happier with them satisfying commercial demand,
even if also for password cracking.  I think what's missing are PCIe
boards with multiple energy-efficient many-core chips per board.  Then
they'd be able to compete not only in terms of energy efficiency, but
also in terms of raw performance per board - for suitable tasks only,
though.  I did discuss this with Andreas, and he agrees.

Another company - Kalray - recently released a PCIe board with their
288-core chip, but it also has only one such chip, and it is pricey:

Regarding the 256 vs. 288 cores confusion, their replies on Twitter:

<@Kalray1@solardiz The MPPA256 has in reality 288 cores !  This brings 288*0.4*(1 branch + 2 ALU + 1 load/store + 1 FMA counted as 2) = 691.2 GOPS !
<@Kalray1@solardiz  The MPPA256 has in reality 288 cores ! This brings  288*0.4*( 1 FMA counted as 2) = 230 GFLOPS !
<@Kalray1@solardiz 16 clusters of 17 cores + 4 quad-cores in the IOs subsystems.

Then there's Tilera, which I think is doing pretty well targeting the
high-speed networking market, providing solutions for traffic monitoring
and DPI (nasty!) and maybe also IDS/IPS and potentially anti-DDoS:

And there's XMOS, but it's about realtime rather than high performance,
so sort of an alternative to small FPGAs (not good for password cracking):

I guess you knew these, but I thought others on this mailing list might
appreciate a summary of current many-core/MIMD archs.

No, I hadn't heard of them.  Are they newish since the end of the
recession?  I've been buried in analog synthesis since then.  I try to
stay current with FPGA and structured ASIC technology.  The last new
startup I was involved with, other than my current company, Triad
Semiconductor, (who bought ViASIC), was Achronix, where I helped tune
their routing a bit.  I haven't seen a new FPGA or structured ASIC
company in a while.

Thanks for the links.  I'm still trying to get my head around
multi-processing in an XMOS microcontroller, but the others all seem
to be massively parallel computation engines.  Is there anything else
I should know about them?
