Did you consider compressing the xi's in the solution? A quick try with
Golomb/Rice Coding would save about 18 bytes in the n=144, k=5 case above
(only 12%). The compression is much better for larger k - ~40% reduction
for n=176, k=10. (I'm assuming that the xi's are randomly distributed, and
that I've read it correctly that they will be in natural order)
