Cool that part got cleared up. Also that "attack passwords before you get
the
hash" is only theoretical because you probably don't know the hashing
algorithm.
Is it MD5(pw), SHA1(pw), MD5(SHA1(pw)), MD5("deliciously-salty-" || pw).

Have a look at bitcoin brain wallets for a practical attack when a salt
isn't used. I've not seen if anyone has estimated the size of the lookup
tables in use in those attacks, but I've tested with some obscure and long
passwords and they are stolen in a second.

I get your point, but for the same reason 12bit salts are a thing there
aren't many hash combinations in practice (only based off my experience
using software, though I think WordPress has a server salt for the
passwords like your deliciously-salty).
