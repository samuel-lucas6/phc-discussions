Subject: Password Hashing done wrong on CISCO IOS

Hi,

Reported by H-Online

"Weakened password hashing found in Cisco devices"

http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Weakened-password-hashing-found-in-Cisco-devices-1827197.html

"The algorithm was incorrectly implemented in version 15 of Cisco's IOS 
operating system, so that instead of using an 80-bit "salt" value, it 
used none, and instead of an intended 1000 iterations through SHA256, it 
used only one."

What can be worst ? :/

Regards.
