Hi, Samuel.  I read your name in several places of the blake2 source
code.  It's very impressive work, from what I can tell.  I pasted the
blake2s interface into Colin Percival's sha256.c to build a
PBKDF2_BLAKE2S function.  I also put a wrapper around blake2s to
generate long blocks of hashed data wherever I need it, such as when
initializing the first block of memory.  In that case, I use the key
and input hash to generate the first 32 bytes, and after that I just
feed the 32 bytes from the output of the previous call as the input to
the next, with no key.  I'm using Blake2s vs Blake2b because it's more
efficient with 32-byte blocks.  I'm making this the smallest block of
memory I can hash, and also the size of the "state" of both the memory
intensive hashing function and the multiplication intensive hashing
function.

Does this approach seem sound to you?  I just want to be sure I'm not
doing something dumb (which is unfortunately often the case).  There
isn't a standard library with PBKDF2_BLAKE2S somewhere, is there?

Thanks,
Bill
