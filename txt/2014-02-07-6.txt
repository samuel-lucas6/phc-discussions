As a specific feature of my design, I'm intending on adjusting the

Here's a patent I found that may impact your idea:

http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=125&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=password.TI.&p=3&OS=TTL/password&RS=TTL/password

Maybe your design gets around it.  I haven't looked very hard to
figure out what it would take.  I guess I'd better do a patent search
for multiplication time hardening of KDFs...
