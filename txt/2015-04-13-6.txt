Subject: Re: [PHC] winner selection

The topic is not specifically about Makwa but I'm not sure that I
understand Gregory's argument.
To me it doesn't make sense to have only one of the crypto primivites
of your system information theoritically secure.
Everything else in Bitcoin relies on computational hardness
assumptions does it not ?
