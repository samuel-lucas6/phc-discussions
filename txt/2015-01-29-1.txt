May be of interest to people on this list. 

For those that might not know, the CFRG is the "crypto forum research group", a working group in the IRTF (the research wing of the IETF).  They review crypto and provide guidance for IETF working groups and publish (mostly information) RFCs defining primitives and protocols, mainly for use by IETF protocols.
