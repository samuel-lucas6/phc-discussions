I downloaded the Sprial source for generating constant
multiplications, and was able to get it to produce an equally good
result in 4 levels and 7 add/subtract blocks.  I had to run it several
times with random seeds but it eventually found it.  If I had to
guess, the main difference between mine and theirs is I have access to
a machine with 128GB of RAM :-)  Well... also theirs does all kinds of
cool stuff where mine is a quick hack.
