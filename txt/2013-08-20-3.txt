Subject: Re: [PHC] Terminology goals

Agree with the need for a name better than "password hashing scheme",
or "password hash".

IIRC in previous Twitter discussions an idea was to avoid the word
"hash" altogether and some people proposed things like "password
scramblers". Also, a good name should probably include a connotation
of work factor/slowness.

Perhaps we should organize a separate competition: The Password Hash
Naming Competition.

Please! I'm tired of putting scare-quotes around "hash" every time I write about this. One of our goals is to make things easier services to do things properly. I still remember the people complaining that BLAKE2 was bad because it was too fast. Separate terms will help make it clear that different things have different design goals.

Nice. I think I might start using that terminology right away. I don't think we need to wait for contest results to start doing this.

(I'd also like something for KDFs that are designed to have a work factor for when the function output isn't for authentication.  "k-desh" for "Key Derivation ScHeme"? But as this the the PHC project and not the KDF-C project, my additional wishes here are off-topic.)
