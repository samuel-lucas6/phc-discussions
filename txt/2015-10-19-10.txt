Here's a draft README.md for Argon2:
https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/README.md <https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/README.md>

Please share your comments here or (better) make pull requests :-)

Since CC0 is a public domain dedication, “copyright (c)” in Intellectual Property statement is rather confusing. You place something by disclaiming copyright  on it, so this better be changed to the wording from CC0 FAQ (https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ <https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ>), e.g.:

- Argon2 code is copyright (c) 2015 Daniel Dinu and Dmitry Khovratovich
- Argon2 code written in 2015 by Daniel Dinu and Dmitry Khovratovich

etc.
