Subject: Re: [PHC] Future CPUs and GPUs?

Now for password crackers... there will be a winner of the PHC.  Most
likely, Solar Designer's schemes will either be the winner directly,
or heavily influence the winner, meaning current GPU attacks are
toast.

FTR, I'm proud that Alex accepted to serve in the PHC panel, however
his submission---as well as those from other panel members---will not
receive any particular treatment, and we'll attempt to minimize
conflicts of interest.I do not expect a one-size-fits-all solution,
and there may be more than one 'winner'.
