FWIW, I think pointing out bugs in reference implementations is absolutely helpful. However, it should have no bearing
on the evaluation of the *algorithm*. There may be cases where the algorithm itself cannot be securely implemented, and
that is a more subtle matter.

In other words, if POMELO or Schvrch have input validation bugs, that does not mean they should be rejected, but it
should be pointed out nonetheless. However, if they present (say) nonrandom behavior or have practical distinguishers of
some kind, or have some computational shortcut, that is a much more serious indictment of the submission.
