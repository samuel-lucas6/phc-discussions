All the tradeoff methods I have tried accumulated highest penalties in
latest blocks. Therefore, the latest blocks should be asked rather
more often - but not always (sliding window), as then the attacker
would not store the first blocks at all.

gambit's solution is a sliding window but xor into memory, which means
all recomputation graphs go back to the origin.
