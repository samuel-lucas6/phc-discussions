A weakness of the hashing function vs scrypt is that it is a simple
non-cryptographic hash, rather than script's Salsa20/8.  This is the
primary reason it runs faster.  If we do not need a strong cryptographic
hash, there is significant opportunity for improving performance.

Afaik, the important property is more that an adversary cannot calculate
what's at each memory location, in a random access model, in less cost than
a memory access.  Or, that the algorithm doesn't create clustered accesses
that can be calculated in a single independent segment.

​As far as I know, as long as what you've generated has some fairly basic
properties and would cost more to calculate than the relevant memory
access, you're fine.​  I'm open to being corrected though: it's been a
while since I've done any reading on this and I'm not entirely convinced
memory-hard functions are the silver bullet they've been made out to be
anyway.
