When discussing SHA-3 candidates, we simply sent our observations to the NIST mailing list. It is sufficient that the Committee is reading this list.

If you have a serious attack, it is recommended to contact the designers first to ensure you got it right.

JP, all -

Can/should we require/ensure that all PHC submitters are subscribed to
the discussions list?  I'd like to be providing feedback on submissions
by simply posting in here, but for some of the submissions I am not sure
if their authors are in here.

Not being in here to comment would put their submissions at a
disadvantage anyway, so maybe we should just discuss in here and assume
that if the authors haven't subscribed, the scheme will probably not
make it into the shortlist of finalists? ;-)  This feels harsh, though,
and it could result in otherwise good schemes being thrown out on a
misunderstanding.  On the other hand, requiring people to be on a
discussion mailing list is not great (we didn't list it among
requirements for PHC submitters), whereas using private e-mail or CC'ing
them is not perfect either.

Thoughts?  Maybe I am imagining this issue, and you can simply check and
tell us that all of the submitters are already subscribed?
