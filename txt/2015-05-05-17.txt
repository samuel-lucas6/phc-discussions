Does this mean you'd like us not to accept even the Argon2 tweaks that
the Argon team has just promised will be ready by the end of this month?

If the panel accepts the Argon2 tweaks, it should give the other finalists 
a decent amount of time to propose tweaks as well. Everything else would 
be extremely unfair.

I wouldn't mind that. But the consequence is clear: This would delay the 
process by a couple of months. Just waiting to the end of this mongth 
won't do.

Does use of BlaMka in Argon2i count as an optimization rather than a tweak?

That sounds like an optimisation to me.

BTW, Catena has very specifically been defined as a framework. You are 
invited to plug in the hash function you like -- including SHA-512, 
BlaMka, and whatever. (The default instantiation is based on Blake2b, but 
that is just one of many allowed instantiations.)

What about a change in block indexing during memory filling?

This is something I would consider a tweak, not an optimization any more.

So long
