My initial guess is not confirmed: I've just pulled the revised
wallet code with some unrelated(?) changes made to it (including my
changes to enable the SIMD code), and its 64-bit build works just
fine on the same system where a 64-bit build previously failed for
me.  So I guess the bug was different (and I guess it's still in
there and might show up again in some builds or after some more
changes).  I've e-mailed the developer with these observations.

They have another bug where if you start mining before syncing, you
wind up creating an alternate chain where people get stuck forever.
Some people are even trying to trade the coins on the wrong branch :-p

They had trouble syncing people initially, so many of us just started
mining anyway, and that didn't work out.  I've switched to the main
chain, which required deleting my copy of everything and starting
over.  I've won 6 blocks so far with my son's MineCraft server, so
it's still fun.  He wants half :-)

Actually, it is possible that you mined those 1,388 BSTY just fine,
if your build was luckier than mine.  I only have 0.01 BSTY from a
faucet now (in the new wallet), as well as tens of thousands of
fake BSTY in the unlucky-build old wallet (which only some other
nodes were willing to confirm - perhaps the similarly unlucky
ones).

Perhaps it's some out-of-bounds memory access problem, or maybe
it's padding of fields in a struct (whereas other portions of code
use the struct as if it were packed, with no field alignments), or
similar.

I am not willing to spend time debugging the wallet.  Someone else
may.

Meanwhile, there's standalone minerd:

https://github.com/noncepool/cpuminer-yescrypt 
http://forum.globalboost.org/index.php?topic=197.0

which works fine for me (and the rebuilt new wallet happens to
work, too).  It does 11.03 kh/s on 2x E5-2670, and 3.47 kh/s on
i7-4770K. (I built it with "-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -march=native"
on each.)

There are also several pools (3 of them so far?)  This one works
for me, along with minerd above:

Thanks for the pointers!  I had to start over, but I'm just letting it
run constantly at about 3,200 h/s.  I'm kind of enjoying letting it
run without a pool for now.
