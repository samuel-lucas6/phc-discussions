I'm pretty confident this hash does that.  I imagine the best brains in
this business just noodle a new hash function out of thin air.  Instead, I
iterated with the dieharder randomness test suite until I got a reasonably
fast result without dieharder telling me it's total crud (it passes most,
but not all tests).  I doubt the final derived password has any useful
predictability.

As far as I know, as long as what you've generated has some fairly basic
properties and would cost more to calculate than the relevant memory
access, you're fine.  I'm open to being corrected though: it's been a
while since I've done any reading on this and I'm not entirely convinced
memory-hard functions are the silver bullet they've been made out to be
anyway.

Being a non-expert in the field, I don't know what those basic properties
are!  Some hash functions I tested eventually spit out nothing but 1's or
0's and others spit out the same sequence of values over and over, and this
function does not seem to do that.  Still, it probably has an embarrassing
bug and/or huge security hole...

As for being a silver bullet... the more I learn about scrypt, the more
impressed I become.  The only "mistake" I can point to is that he failed to
foresee the fear people would have for his new algorithm.  If I could make
a 4-character change to his code, it would simply be replacing 1 with 2048,
so that his algorithm would start with industry accepted key stretching,
and build from there.    Thanks for the feedback!
