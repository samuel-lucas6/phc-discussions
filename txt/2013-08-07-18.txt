For the first step a machine with pmem^{1/2} memory which
stores every pmem^{1/2}th value. This runs in pmem time

I could see how one could do it if it were ‘append’ instead of ‘prepend’, but how does one run

      pmem.times do
        chain.prepend(link)
        link = hash.call(salt, link)
      end

in just pmem time?

Are you perhaps treating hash.call as constant time, or counting the individual hash compression function invocations?
