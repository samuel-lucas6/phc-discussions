I just found that AuthenticAMD0700F01_K16_Kabini_InstLatX86.txt (AMD
A4-5000 APU at 1.5 GHz) lists "PMULUDQ xmm, xmm" and "VPMULUDQ xmm, xmm,
xmm" as having 2 cycles latency.  While this improvement over 3 cycles
(best across other CPUs) is almost certainly due to the lower clock
rate, it's still impressive.  This same file lists scalar *MUL as 3+
cycles latency, and 4 cycles for high 32 bits.  So the SIMD form of
32x32->64 is twice faster than scalar (in terms of latency) on this CPU
for high 32 bits of result.

I was just looking at the same thing; this AMD chip is very impressive! Namely, this chip should also have

 - The fastest AES-GCM speeds (in cycles/byte) of any x86 architecture.
 - The fastest binary elliptic curve scalar multiplication (see [1]) of any x86 architecture.

The reason for this is that 64-bit carryless multiplication, PCLMULQDQ, has twice the throughput and half the latency of
Haswell.
