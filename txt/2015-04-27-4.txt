I updated PHC candidates test with latest run

https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/phc_round2.pdf

- many code updates announced here (including Argon, Catena, MAKWA,
etc) - added parallel test - I used newer machine for test (Lenovo
x240 i7 CPU) - Added pwxround=2 yescrypt to normalized test -
yescrypt now uses -opt version (not reference) (I did not add it to
other test these were meant to use defaults). - All tested passwords
are now randomly generated (/dev/urandom) (previously were hardcoded
in test program)


This is a great update, and I know how hard this is.  Thanks for
doing it!

Two things would improve it, IMO.  First, improve contrast.  Being
massively color blind, I cannot read half of the lines on your
charts.  Make sure that 2 of 3 of the RGB values are no higher than
half (128), if you can, and if you can only do that with one color,
make it green or blue, not red.

I tried to update linetypes, it should be better now for you,
please check it.

(Unfortunately I found only usable color palette for 8 series, so
here it repeats colors just with different symbols - but is should be readable.)

Also changed PPC test to use up to 160 processes.

The other thing is that we're still missing what I feel is the most
important charge for your use case: full disk encryption.  There is
simply no reaon not to use the multi-core capability of the machine.
Most entries do not have a parallelism parameter, but it is an
absolutely critical feature for FDE.

yes, but the whole testsuite is based on using PHC() function prototype.

So either we should implement an another common interface for all candidates
or I can run some targeted tests later (on finalists).

(Authors should decide how to map the parallel attribute to internals.
There can be parallelism on more levels etc - I do not want to
make a decision how to map that parameter.)

Thanks,
Milan
