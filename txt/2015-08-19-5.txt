1) Would you attribute these results to the existing Argon2 parallelism in
the compression function (8 x parallel Blake2)? Do you already exploit this
feature? If yes, then we already have a more sequential pattern in mind,
that would be great to test with or without Maxform.

We don't yet exploit this (except possibly to a very limited extent that
an OpenCL compiler and the hardware might), so I wouldn't attribute the
current results to it.  I've been thinking of communicating suggestions
on how to try exploiting this to Agnieszka today.  So we'll likely try.

Here are my suggestions on trying to exploit this parallelism in OpenCL:

We're also considering prefetching:

and optimizing the modulo operation:

We'd appreciate other suggestions on these and other potential
optimizations.  e.g. I guess Samuel or Thomas might have more
suggestions on specific ways to optimize the modulo operation.
