I think that collisions for this hash function can be found by
differential cryptanalysis, where differences are injected in block[0],
block[1], and block[128*128-1]. The first two compensate each other in the
state, and the third one cancels the difference in buffer[0].

Wow!  That was fast!  I figured this would have people stumped at least
until after lunch :-)

That's a brilliant attack on the idea.  My guess is that there will be
similar attacks on modified versions, or else most likely we'd already be
using this technique.  It's not complex enough for me to be the first guy
to think of it.

I'll keep thinking about it for a bit...
