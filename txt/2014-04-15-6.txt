I'm guessing that's 50%-70% or 50x-70x?


Fast with AES-NI (five-round AES)

I added this one and for EARWORM that uses single round AES. The faster the
mixing of data, the more memory you can use. So being fast is a good property,
but not being standards compliant or reduced rounds is bad for security.
Although it might not be broken it's just harder to prove that it's secure. Also
it loses a lot of speed if you don't have AES-NI.
