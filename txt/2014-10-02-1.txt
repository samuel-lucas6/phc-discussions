Dmitry has published some excellent work, but like me, he's not shy of
publishing poor work.  Several of his statements about both Lyra2 and
Yescrypt, as well as others, are lame.  GPU defense is only "claimed"
by Yescrypt?  Good one, Dmitry...

Obviously, he has no problem listing Lyra2 as "attacked" for minor
issues that the Lyra2 team has explained how they will correct, but he
forgot to mention my highly parallel attack on Argon, but in an email
reply says that they take that into account... does that somehow make
it OK?  Apparently, because he gives Argon his highest rating.

He lists "Basic Cryptography" as a strength for Argon, yet "claimed"
for Lyra2 and Yescrypt.  I'm sorry, but that's total BS.  It's really
messed up.

I can't take this analysis seriously.  His ASIC analysis was frankly
stupid, and this table of "Security Analysis" isn't much better.  If
Dmitry would like me to expand on this, I would be happy to, but
frankly, he should cut his losses.  I am looking forward to ripping
this stupid table if he really wants me to :-)

The Argon code is excellent, and I am forced to respect Dmitry as a
programmer.  Honestly, for me, that's what really counts.  He's good.
 However, I'm happy to debunk more of these dumb ratings he keeps making.

Bill
