Subject: Question about saturating the memory bandwidth

Hi,

I have a question about a possible PHC design strategy:
Assume the defender is sitting on a GPU and his/her KDF saturates the
memory bandwidth. The look-up table used in the KDF is large and it does
not depend on the password. How can an attacker achieve a speed up?

Thanks.

Regards,
Ivica
