I'd say that drawing attention to the fact that there is such a contest,
and that it is still in progress (though closed to submissions), is a good
idea. We'd like people to use the contest winners, since they're likely to
be good password hashing functions.

The question I asked is if media attention about the contest is welcome...
  However, maybe it would be easier to ask: does anyone feel the contest
should not be mentioned?
