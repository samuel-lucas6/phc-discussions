Maybe you didn't read what I was responding to, but I was accused of
being incompetent

if the accusation is lack of understanding (which you indeed
demonstrated, though it was a slight misstep in my view), maybe
demonstrating understanding is a better defense than questioning the
accuser's pedigree and bragging about yours. especially if easy to
find information on the internet does not put you in the position of
an expert, so it remains a claim and nothing more.
