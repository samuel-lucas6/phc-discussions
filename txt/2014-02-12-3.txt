Yet commodity hardware comes very highly optimized for memory bandwidth,
so in effect defenders collectively participate in a big economy of scale.
An attacker may be able to do get a better price/performance with custom
hardware, but probably not by much (on the log2 scale).

In short, we can expect that an attacker could fit 512 parallel instances
of MD5 on a custom silicon chip. But it’s probably also a reasonable
assumption that no one has an external RAM subsystem that’s 512 times more
efficient than the latest DDR chips.

So essentially, a hardware attacker can:

- use compute operations much cheaper than defender;

- use memory storage at the roughly the same cost as defender;

- use memory bandwidth at roughly the same cost per hash operation as the
defender.

Have I got that correct?


>From what I understand - and I don't know how far down the road they
actually are - there are ASICs being produced to do scrypt hashes because
it's used in Litecoin, presumably with the side-effect that these
appliances can be used for cracking password hashes too.  Is it likely that
the need for significantly improved memory bandwidth in other contexts -
for example high-performance computing in the sciences - will drive an
improvement in technology such that the assumptions on memory bandwidth
limitations will fail in the near future?

And as a slight tangential: is it worth candidate algorithms for PHC having
a tunable to create ever-so-slight changes in computation such that any
adoption by a crypto currency isn't going to indirectly encourage hardware
specifically for cracking password hashes to be produced?
