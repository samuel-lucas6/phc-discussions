To clarify: I'd talk of optimizations rather than tweaks, after
we've selected the winner. I'm not planning another round of tweaks
and evaluations that would delay the process. If the panel selects
some Argon2 variant as a winner, the final version may be optimized
jointly with the authors. A bit like Keccak/SHA3 was optimized after being selected by NIST.

just ftr sha3 was not optimized after selection. the original nist
draft chose a different parametrization of keccak. but it was a
totally legit keccak instance. and the reason was that their
requirements wasn't carefully stated, so they fixed that, and
reparametrized keccak accordingly.
