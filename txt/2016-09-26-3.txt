Subject: Re: [PHC] Can we add back Argon2id?

If I could change Argon2 to only offer Argon2i and Argon2id, I would.  The
complexity is the same as offering only Argon2i and Argon2d, but Argon2id
provides better defense than Argon2d.  I do not understand the rationale
for promoting Argon2d instead of Argon2id.
