Subject: EARWORM speed and improved defense

Here's the raw data when calling EARWORM's PHS function:
PHCtime ./phs-earworm $((1 << 20)) 10000
Creating arena
Allocating 268435456 bytes
Hashing password
count:1048576

7b 46 5d db ff b2 ef 85
25 af 9a 5a 0c 65 76 74
78 62 ff 52 92 e0 ca 1e
d5 6f 59 15 fc 40 10 d2      32 (octets)


real    1m25.882s
user    1m25.907s
sys     0m0.017s

It spent at least 2 seconds creating the "arena" which is a shared ROM.
 Subtracting that out, and I get:

Total memory hashed: 1 TiB
Time: 83 seconds
Bandwidth: 12.3 GiB/s

This is the highest memory bandwidth I've measured, though I've factored
out memory allocation, and if I did that with Yescript and Lyra2, they
might be close to this.
