Do you have specific numbers for the original approach above, and what
would be high enough (in your opinion)?

I would like to hurt a guy using only 1/4 of the memory enough that
his attack is not practical.  I also want to not spend much time in
the second loop forcing an attacker to show memory locations, so I'd
like to read only 1% of the blocks.  A guy using only 1/8th should be
deep into impractical TMTO territory.

How do you implement thread-level parallelism, or is this scheme with
the second loop at 1% only suitable for p=1?

The average recalculation for 10,000,000 nodes covered by evenly
spaced pebbles [...]

What if they are not evenly spaced?  You're making the distribution of
lookup indices highly non-uniform, so perhaps an attacker with limited
memory can adjust the spacing accordingly and achieve a lower TMTO
penalty?
