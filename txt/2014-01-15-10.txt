But it does feel somewhat risky, and the latency guarantee is probably
similar to that of the integer multiply (not the latency per se, but
how it compares between CPUs and attack-optimized ASICs).  A possible
advantage of the hash127 approach would be in using more of the die
area, especially in defensive implementations on GPU and many-core archs
(those many FPUs combined consume non-negligible die area).

While using floating-point by itself might be an actionable idea, I'd
advise not to use hash127. hash127 was designed during a time where even
32-bit integer multiplication was slow; now we have very fast 64-bit
integers multipliers, which make hash127 much faster to compute in
integer units.

Ideally whatever you compute using the floating-point unit should be
something that is hard to replicate with integer hardware.
