yescrypt is being criticized primarily for being overly(?) complex,

and this is a valid criticism. simplicity is not just convenience in
crypto. it is about implementation correctness, verifiability, ability
to reason about the algorithm itself in terms of math.

Makwa's delegation is probably not something that could reasonably be
added

you really need to design a primitive from the ground up with
delegation in mind. in fact i would be very pleased to see a
makwa-like number theoretic kdf that has high (and tunable) memory
requirement, and a blinding option. that would be the perfect
candidate in my opinion.
