What timezone? ;-)

Samoa,

I assume you mean American Samoa, which is UTC-11, since Samoa is
actually 14 hours ahead of UTC right now (giving submitters less time).

"The nation of Samoa also observed the same time as the Samoa Time Zone
until it moved across the International Date Line at the end of 29
December 2011; it is now 24 hours (25 hours in summer) ahead of American
Samoa."

Baker Island and Howland Island are also nice:

and small delays may be tolerated :)

Sounds good.
