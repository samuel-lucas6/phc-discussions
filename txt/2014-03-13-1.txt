Subject: Catena conjecture correction

Now that my code seems stable-ish, I'm looking back into the math
behind pebbling proofs.  I see no error in Catena's, however, the
Catena paper also makes the following conjecture:

    T G^(L+1)/(S^L)

Where T is the number of pebble moves required, and L is lambda.

I think there is a slight error in the paper two equations before:

    G*(G/2S)^L = G^(L+1)/(2*S^L)

It should be 2^L, not 2.

I verified that Catena-2 can be pebbled with equal spaced pebbles in
rows 1 and 2 with S == G/4 with a recomputation penalty of 8, rather
than the predicted 16.
