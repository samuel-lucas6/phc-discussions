It's checked a few lines down with 'value >= ( MAX_INTLENGTH / 10 )', where
'value' is the input to the multiply.  My programming style is to use consts
as much as possible, so I create the const where it has to be set at the start
and then check that it was OK before using it.

Paranoid programming, check everything from five different directions if
possible.  It should actually be stated as an invariant:

  INVARIANT( value >= 0 && value <= MAX_INTLENGTH );

but that throws an exception which I don't want in this case.
