So without the check for 0:

-- Snip --

[F:\Work]Test64.exe
-2147483556

[F:\Work]

-- Snip --

with the check for 0:

-- Snip --

[F:\Work]Test64.exe

[F:\Work]

-- Snip --

That's built with /O2, maximise speed.

So while the Gnu folks are still accommodating one's-complement CDC 6600's
from 1965 (not sure if the 7600 was one's or two's-complement, but the later
Cybers and Cray-1 weren't any more), Microsoft have realised that INT_MAX +
100 = -ve on any known architecture.  It is somewhat disturbing to see that
LLVM is following the Gnu braindamage though...
