Maybe it would be easier to just make a diagram ;)

I've removed some of the gnarlier Ruby elements from the code and peppered
it with a few more comments. Is it easier to understand now?

Sorry, perhaps I should rewrite my example in Python in a style more

Not my call, whatever others on the list like is fine with me. Just
consider the audience, and you can do that as well (or probably better
than) I. My understanding was that we were just discussing ideas, not
actual submissions (which will need an implementation in C). Maybe
pseudocode will work for this. A lot of folks seem to like Python too.

I didn't have much trouble reading Trevor Perrin's Python, but I note that
it didn't *actually* seem to be parallelizing over multiple threads. The
Ruby looked like it would run in parallel, except that the normal
interpreter doesn't do that. Go figure!
