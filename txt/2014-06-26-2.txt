Since, for password hashing, we want code which is faster on a PC than

worst on a FPGA. From this point of view, using CLMUL looks like a
not-so-good idea.

I fully agree if we s/FPGA/ASIC/g above.  For FPGAs, I am not so sure.

In modern FPGAs, there are usually many 18x18 multipliers (and we can
build larger multipliers from those).  I don't know if it's possible and
cheap to use them in carry-less mode, or if this would mean spending
other resources.  So I wouldn't be surprised if CLMUL actually turns out
to be less FPGA-friendly than traditional MUL.

Perhaps someone with experience of implementing elliptic curves in FPGA
can comment on this.
