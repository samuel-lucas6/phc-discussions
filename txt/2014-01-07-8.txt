      Password Key Derivation Based On The Sponge Construction

Hi,

Well, this was an initial presentation trying to explain why using memory
is an interesting idea: the numbers in the mentioned slide are completely
bogus, but could be achieved using PBKDF-MD5 or some other scheme, and
that is the idea behind the text.

But I fully agree that naively mentioning this speed for MD5 is completely
misleading (it is better to simply say "a KDF"). Thank you for pointing it
out.

BR,

Marcos Simplicio.

Hm. If I understand the concept correctly, this is sort of similar to
the candidate I have been working on.

However, in the presentation linked on that site, the assertion on slide
8.2 (K20X only pulling 1.3 MH/s on MD5) is ludicrious. They're off by
three orders of magnitude, and then some. In reailty, the K20X can pull
about 5 GH/s on MD5, which is about what they reckoned the GPU could do
per hour. This leads me to believe they don't really have a firm grasp
on the attack landscape, which might mean they do not understand how an
attacker might implement and optimize Lyra. I'd have to study it more to
see if their claims hold up.

But yes, I think someone should reach out to them and see if they wish
