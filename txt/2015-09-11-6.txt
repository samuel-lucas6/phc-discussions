Off-topic, but related and interesting:




Though probably not prosecuted very often, adultery is a felony in several US states:

In Wisconsin, for example, both the adulterer, and the person with whom the adulterer adults, are liable for a class I felony, punishable by fines of up to $10,000, and prison terms of up to 3.5 years:

I find this backwards, and an infringement on the rights of swingers and people in open relationships (the law appears to contain no exception for this). It's also an outrageous hammer that can be used to selectively hit people with (especially given the consequences of landing a felony).




But there you go.

Well, my post still holds, on the fact that having an account with AM
doesn't prove anything "illegal" by itself. Unless of course having an
unverififed account with a dating service by itself is morally wrong.
Legally its not afaik.

The amount of passwords cracked by @CynoPrime however, and their current
estimates says they will crack 90-95% of all the passwords - for all
accounts, I have no doubt AM have completely FUBAR their password
storage implementation.

Per,

To be fair MD5AM and MD5AM2 were deprecated as legacy.

Would it be reasonable to assume that this sample of accounts are
within the scope of your post at
