There is also a PhD thesis on the topic http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/csl/tr/94/617/CSL-TR-94-617.pdf

But anyway, as 32-bit multiplication is equivalent to a sum of 16 (average) addends, it can not be more than 4x slower given sufficient area (which we have).

You can certainly do the n^2 ANDs and add things up, but that seems like a waste of gates. What is the cost metric being
considered here? Time (circuit depth)? Area? Time * Area?

As a theoretical curiosity, Brent and Kung [1] came up with an optimal area-time n-bit multiplier of depth O(n^(1/2) log
n) and area O(n log n). Melhorn-Preparata's [2] circuit would be O(log n), O(n^2 / log n). The above would be
(asymptotically) depth O(log n) and area O(n^2).
