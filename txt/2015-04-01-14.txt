just a quick question: wouldn't it be easier and more precise to
calculate the memory requirement instead of measuring it? it should be
quite straightforward from the algorithms.

The whole point of these tests initially were to *measure* real parameters
and detect possible bugs and unexpected limits.

It just now slightly shifted to something more, so adding comparison
with theoretic calculation is probably also needed.
The last test just use calculated values to present kind of normalized output,
but in graph is presented only measured value.
