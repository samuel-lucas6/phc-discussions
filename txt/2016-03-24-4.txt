Thinking of it some more, the exception may actually be important, still
allowing to attack the last 1 or 2 rounds.  So my proposed change isn't
as complete a mitigation as hashing in the key length would be.

What about starting a round counter (which gets hashed) from a different, non-overlapping, value for different key sizes?

128-bit key: round# = 0, 1, 2, 3
256-bit key: round# = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
