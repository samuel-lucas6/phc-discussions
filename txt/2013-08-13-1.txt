I really like the use of the AES intrinsic operations for performance.
 Unfortunately, right now, this does seem to make the algorithm very
x86-centric - I am not aware of AES hardware acceleration on ARM
processors, which means that this wouldn't work well for anything
not-x86.  However, it also (right now) badly cripples GPUs as they
have to AES in software.  I'm not sure that it would offer much of a
benefit over FPGAs, though if you've forced an attacker to FPGAs to
get major speedups, you're doing well.

Since we don't know what area/latency/throughput tradeoffs
Intel/AMD/future ARM licensees made when implementing AES-NI, it is
possible that an FPGA/ASIC attacker could have a significant advantage
over the defender. Depending on the scheme, bitsliced GPU AES could also
perhaps be competitive.
