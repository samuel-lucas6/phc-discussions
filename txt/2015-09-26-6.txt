Agreed.  In fact, Thomas' own sample code for Argon2 places t before p.

It also has optional keyid and data parameters, contrary(?) to what the
proposed specification previously said.

I'd also encourage a non-bloated syntax, since there's no benefit of having
a better human-readable encoding. Also important is the consistency with
the current standard.

I wouldn't go as far as to say "there's no benefit of having a better
human-readable encoding" - I think it's nice for the encoding to be
human-readable, but this also has drawbacks, including even "looking
bad" to some humans. ;-)

I think I'm going to give a compact syntax a try in yescrypt, and then
we'll see if we're going to reuse most of it for other PHC schemes.

I am still very interested in any comments you (JP, Thomas, others)
might have on my proposed compact encodings for the numeric parameters.
