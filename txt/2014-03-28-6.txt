Implying it's not competitive...

Sorry... Even among geeks, I seem socially impaired.

I like PufferFish the way it is, but as Alexander pointed out, when
you bust out of L1 cache, performance drops.  When you bust out of L3
into DRAM, if I read the code correctly, performance will drop a ton.
I'd be a hypocrite for not suggesting that you take his advice and
implement the wandering 4KiB window in the 2^cost loop.  Over half of
my submission is built on ideas he suggested.  I just hope there can
be some way for him to formally "win" regardless of which submission
built on his ideas wins.

I give myself credit for knowing good ideas when I see them.  The
wandering 4KiB window seems like a winner to me.
