According to the email from Dimitry, it is ok to me, so no objection.

(I do not have time to compare the different versions of the candidates, so
I only consider the information in the email of Dimitry.)

Yes.  Quoting my reply to you on the panel list on February 3:

This is unfair to them in that they had expected their more-than-tweaks
would not be accepted, so did not even try to submit such.  It would
have been preferable for us to state that we'd be willing to accept
"major changes" rather than merely "tweaks" when we announced the
finalists in December, if we're in fact to accept Argon2.  Then it'd be
fair to other finalists.

However, given the actual finalists we have, I would be surprised if
they actually wanted to make major changes.  OTOH, I was surprised by
Argon2 being introduced.  So I could be wrong.
