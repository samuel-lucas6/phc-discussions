We may be flexible if that is likely to benefit the project.

However we won't accept submissions after the initial deadline. And round 2
is about shortlisting a few submissions rather than receiving new ones. The
game has to have rules :)

What do other panel members think?

That was _so_ last November. Why do you have to bring up the past? :P


  Personally, I think the deadline is fine as it is: it's been advertised
for a year.


A year is not a very long time. Some people (not me, of course) only found
out about the competition a few months ago. Some people will not find out
about it until Monday. Maybe a year is not long enough. But maybe it is.

I personally would like to see it extended just because I haven't found any
time at all to work on my submission since October, and I'm really sweating
the deadline. Nov - Feb are extremely hectic for me, as I imagine they are
for many of you as well. I am strongly in favor of the revised timeline.
