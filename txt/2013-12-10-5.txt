Personally I prefer output = encrypt(site_key, slow_hash(salt, password)). Since

* Key doesn't need to integrated into the hashing scheme
* Key can be changed without access to the password
* Key can be put into a HSM (which only allows encryption, not
decryption or export) which can't afford to compute the slow hash
