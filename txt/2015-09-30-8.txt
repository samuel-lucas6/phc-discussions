Subject: PHC release delay: Oct 1st -Nov 1st

Hi all,

we planned to release the final version of the PHC winner and of the
special recognitions by Q3. We'll have to delay this one by a month, sorry.
The main reason is that the code and string format specification of the
final Argon2 are not ready to be released yet.

We now plan to release the packages (specs and code) by Nov 1st.

To submitters of special recognition algorithms:

You have another month to finalize your submission (deadline = Nov 1st). If
we haven't heard from you by then, the current version will be considered
as final (as far as PHC is concerned).

Thank your for your understanding,

JP
