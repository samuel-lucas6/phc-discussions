I have been told on the AMD CL forum (by 'realhet', who appears very
proficient and up to date with GCN ASM) that GCN has no instruction
latencies (i.e. it can consume a result in the instruction immediately
following), probably a nice implication of the instructions being processed
in 4-clock 'ticks'.

realhet wrote an assembler/Pascal/IDE targeting GCN, so got to be very
proficient with GCN.  Can you post an URL for that specific forum posting?

In the following old thread, it was said that while 4 wavefronts could
be sufficient for ALU bound problems, more are needed for memory bound
problems (not surprisingly), and I think this might include local memory
(but I don't really know):

(In that old thread, I think comments by jeff_golds are authoritative,
while realhet was just learning then-new GCN at the time.)

Anyway, I think this means that if we put the S-boxes into local memory,
we do incur at least those 4 cycle minimum latencies.
