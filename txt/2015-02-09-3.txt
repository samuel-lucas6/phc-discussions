Hi,

This is a personal reply on an issue I feel I readily have a comment on.
Not a reply on behalf of the panel.

1. The document mentions that the decision was "Based on the discussions on
the public and private mailing lists ....". I am curious to know what were
the discussions in the "private mailing lists". Shouldn't they be in public
already ? Further, if the decision used these "private mailing lists", is
it not not unfair to the 2nd round candidate designs whose authors are not
in the panel ? Clearly, the panelists whose designs are advancing have some
more knowledge about the analysis which is not accessible to others.

This was actually my biggest concern about possible biases, and one of
the reasons why I chose to be on the panel despite of intending to make
my own submission - to personally ensure we do bring any new analysis to
the public list in a timely fashion.

For the submissions we (later) ended up selecting as finalists, there
were two such occasions.  For POMELO:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2214

(and I think this actually affected how POMELO was tweaked).

For Makwa:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2073

I also recall asking Steve to post this on PolyPassHash, which he did:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2070

(although we ended up not selecting PolyPassHash as a finalist).

And yes, there was not that much new analysis by the panel members.
I hope there will be more of it now, focusing on the (tweaked)
finalists - and I hope it will be posted right to the public list (or
I'll be asking for it to be brought in here).
