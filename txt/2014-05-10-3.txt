Thanks for the link. I read: The jury found that Google infringed Oracle’s
copyrights in the 37 Java packages and a specific computer routine called
“rangeCheck,”

Oracle succeeded in copyrighting their API.  Had this happened in the days
of Unix, God only knows what kind of computing we'd have today.
