It's OK to make two submissions, but the reason you give is not good
enough for that, in my opinion.  Instead of making two submissions, can
you define TwoCats and SkinnyCat such that SkinnyCat can be computed
with TwoCats?  That way, SkinnyCat will be an implementation of a subset
of the functionality of TwoCats, and it can be part of the same
submission.  Just a cut-down implementation included in the submission,
and maybe also a second specification document for the cut-down version.

TwoCats in the PHC portfolio, I'm not sure how we'd approach that if
it's not submitted separately.  I guess we'd ask you to package it
separately at that time.

Sounds good to me, though I still have work to do on TwoCats and the
deadline is close!

If SkinnyCat is strictly a subset of TwoCats, I think you may add it
after the deadline, and not necessarily as part of your formal
submission.  This is my opinion, not an official position of the PHC panel.
