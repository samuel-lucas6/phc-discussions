This works better.  With the modified, code, POMELO now passes the
first test, the Birthday test.  This is, I believe, similar to
Alexander's favorite test of counting collisions in small integers,
such as 32-bit integer outputs.  Any PHS that passes the Birthday
test, if then run through a cryptographically strong hash such as
SHA2, will then pass any test for randomness.  That's why I consider
it the most important test, since most PHS entries will pass their
output one last time through a cryptographic hash.  If you pass the
Birthday test, and use a cryptographic final hash, you're golden so
far as output randomness goes.


Actually, in order to match the spec it should be

    for (i = 128; i < saltlen + 128; i++)
        ((unsigned char*)S)[i] = ((unsigned char*)salt)[i];
    for (i = saltlen + 128; i < 160; i++)
         ((unsigned char*)S)[i] = 0;

I confirm that the birthday test passes after making this fix.
