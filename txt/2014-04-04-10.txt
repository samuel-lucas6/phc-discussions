Now that I've seen a couple entries that use the new AESENC

Just a bit of pedantry: the best latency for AESENC I know of is 7 cycles on Haswell. You can dispatch 1 every cycle
(per core) in every chip, though. What this roughly means is that you can perform ~7-8 parallel AES encryptions for the
cost of one.
