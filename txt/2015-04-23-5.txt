I updated PHC candidates test with latest run

 https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/phc_round2.pdf

- many code updates announced here (including Argon, Catena, MAKWA, etc)
- added parallel test
- I used newer machine for test (Lenovo x240 i7 CPU)
- Added pwxround=2 yescrypt to normalized test
- yescrypt now uses -opt version (not reference)
(I did not add it to other test these were meant to use defaults).
- All tested passwords are now randomly generated (/dev/urandom)
(previously were hardcoded in test program)

(Git history contains all changes.)

Thanks for all suggestion and thanks algorithms authors for fixing bugs!

Milan
