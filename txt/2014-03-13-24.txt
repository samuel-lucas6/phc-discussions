If you can leverage a slow PHF, the attack becomes far more asymmetrical
in terms of what it costs the attacker versus the resulting impact on your
system.

There's no such thing as a "general DDoS protection" any more than there
is a general solution to someone taking down your power grid. You must
consider every aspect of the request pipeline from your upstream PoPs to
your backend applications, and the solutions you implement at each step of
the way apply to every part of your application. Every part of the request
pipeline is vulnerable in different ways.

You need to armor your upstream PoPs via automated BGP flowspec
directives, ensure an attacker can't exhaust the capacity of your HTTP
routing mesh, and ensure that your backend apps can't spin indefinitely on
slow endpoints. There are no general solutions to this. None.

When I say general protection I'm not implying that there is a One Way to
prevent DDoS: I am saying that there are mechanisms to combat a DDoS that
work equally well for a DDoS being performed through a username, contact
form, or password field.

I understand what you are saying, but I am completely unconvinced that this
hypothetical attack is any reason whatsoever that we should discourage
people from strengthening their password digests. (Not to mention most
companies won't *ever* have a DDoS problem!) Where is the evidence?
