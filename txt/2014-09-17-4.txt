Subject: Re: [PHC] omegacrypt and timing

The running time will be different, but the question is how you are going
to exploit it without full hashing. Suppose you have the time information,
then you do only partial hashing and look at the running time of this part.
Both running times should have normal distribution, so you might be able to
calculate your advantage in terms of false positive and false negative
rates. However, to win even a factor of two, your distributions should have
very large sigma, which is doubtful if you have say millions of branches.

can someone explain me how omegacrypt does not leak secret through
timing? i mean total runtime, not cache timing.

in the central part, we derive 0..3 number B from the secret, and
based on that value we do different branches that has different number
of operations. B will on average have all possible values with the
same probability, but there will be a deviation. therefore for two
given passwords, the total running time is different.

am i right?
