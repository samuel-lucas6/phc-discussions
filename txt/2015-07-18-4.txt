He did.  Jeremy claims to have independently arrived at this in July
2012, but intentionally not publishing it yet for the purpose of
patenting it.  I find this plausible.

I thought that, for a patentability, only the situation at the moment of 
filing patent application matters, no?

It did look pretty bad to me in this way at first, but Jeremy managed to
convince me it was in fact independent discovery, a few months before my
ZeroNights talk.  What still looks bad to me is the very fact this
useful stuff is patented (although the patent might be fully or
partially invalid due to other prior art).

I think Jeremy did nothing illegal.

Like knowing a specific piece of prior art and intentionally not 
disclosing it? Hm.

Anyway, you could consider contacting someone from the following projects:
