I actually designed a lot of the original eASIC architecture :-)

Wow.

While I'm a self-professed crypto-dabbler and password hashing noob, I
actually am an expert at FPGA and structured ASIC architectures and
tools to place and route them.  The eASIC architecture isn't nearly as
good as ViASIC's for high density high speed deep sub-micron digital
architectures, but eASIC got the funding to build it.  I wouldn't
attempt to create an eASIC competitor at 20nm without several million
to do it.

I wasn't aware of ViASIC:

What's the pricing of these companies like?
