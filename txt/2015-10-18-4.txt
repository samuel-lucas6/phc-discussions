Just noticed that the string encoding defined by Thomas has a single
parallelism parameter whereas Argon2 supports distinct number of lanes and
number of threads, which can't be encoded with a single parameter. I don't
think that's a problem though, I don't see many reasons why implementations
wouldnt have #lane=#threads.

Number of threads is a runtime parameter that doesn't affect output, so it doesn't really need to be encoded; it's up to
the system configuration/implementation to figure out what the optimal thread count should be. Lanes, on the other hand,
must be there.
