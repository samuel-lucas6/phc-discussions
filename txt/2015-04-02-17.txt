This is correct, but not the full picture. At some Fast Software 
Encryption (FSE) conference, a representative from the NIST (I believe, it 
was Bill Burr, but I am not sure) had been asking us cryptographers about 
our wish-list for a DES-successor. The answer was quite clear: support for 
128-bit and 256-bit keys, and for 128- and 256-bit blocks. Two key sizes, 
two block sizes would have made four variants. I never understood why some 
bureaucrats at the NIST decided that four was too much, but three would be 
great, and then gave us the useless variant with 192-bit keys(*), instead 
of a 256-bit block size. This is one of the worst cryptographic choices 
the NIST ever made(**), IMHO. Even two variants (128-bit keys and blocks, 
and 256-bit keys and blocks) would have made more sense(***) than any 
support for the intermediate key length of 192 bit. But a standard is a 
standard is a standard ...

Back to PHC:

Reducing the number of choices makes make a good standard.

But beware of offering too few or the wrong choices!

So long

----------

(*) I know plenty of applications of AES with 128-bit keys, and plenty of 
applications of AES with 256-bit keys. But I haven't heard of any 
application with specific support for 192-bit AES and no other AES 
variant. Of course, applications with a variety of "cipher suite" options 
usually support all three AES variants, for the sake of completeness.

(**) The decision to standardize DUAL-EC-DRBG is far out of comparison!

(***) For what its worth: There would not have been much need for the 
SHA-3 competition, if there had been an AES variant with 256-bit block 
size when SHA-1 was attacked. A block cipher based hash function could 
have provided a decent "backup", for the case that the attacks on SHA-1 
would have endangered the SHA-2 family as well.
