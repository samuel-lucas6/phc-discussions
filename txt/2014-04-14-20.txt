i wasn't aware that the wiki is open for editing. not that i want to
manage anyone's lives, but if i may have a suggestion:

Me either :).


i would not go awry with the editing. i think maintaining the
information there should be mostly the task of the panel and whoever
they ask. if someone edits, we need to conform to strict guidelines to
maintain unified style and phrasing.

I don't think people that submitted algorithms should be able to edit other
algorithms' wiki pages. Even though I submitted and I'm editing other
algorithms' wiki pages, but I feel like it's my duty to help anywhere I can
with PHC because I'm on the panel. I really just started writing pseudocode
so I could get an in depth look at the algorithms and simple reminders of
how they work. I thought it was useful so I started posting them. I also
tried to be as unbiased as I can and put warnings on them: "strengths are
not written by designers. Blame Steve for this being wrong or incomplete."

Side note I trust other panel members that have also submitted with editing
mine because if this becomes a problem they might be kicked off the panel.
As would I if I did the same.


here are some of my, uncalled for, woes, taken from catena page:

i don't think that "provably" adds anything, it is obviously cache
timing resistant.

did it? which ones? anyway, it is not important.

advanced is a weasel word

"KISS"

not sure i would use this term in this context, but also arguable and

just my 2c.

I noticed that too but TwoCats takes the cake:
