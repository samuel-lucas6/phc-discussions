Note I believe there might be a problem with some of it: battcrypt on 5x and
POMELO on 3x and 5x. Since those algorithms don't have t_costs for those and I
think they are run at lower settings.

Nope, it is just empty legend (otherwise it would switch colors among series:)
I'll mark them with some strike-out font then...

It is temporary chart, there is wrong calculation for Catena still...

But ignoring that these are the best benchmarks I've seen since they're
normalized for rounds across memory and time vs memory (instead of having t_cost
or m_cost as an axis).

I'll update my report once it is complete.
