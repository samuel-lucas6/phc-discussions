Subject: Use of language

Gentlemen - and ladies;

This is not my mailing list. I'm not a moderator. I am far away of
claiming to understand half of what is written here.

Keep on bashing at each others candidates and professional opinions, but
please, lets not get down to "Fox News" levels of language against each
others personalities and opinions. That is highly unprofessional.

As my parents told me; once you go personal on people instead of subject
of discusssion, you loose.

BR,
Per Thorsheim
