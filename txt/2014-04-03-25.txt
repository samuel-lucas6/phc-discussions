Subject: antcrypt phs_gen_output()

Hey Guys,

from antcrypt sources, do I understand this correctly:

ctx->state_bytes = some static value based on m_cost
*(ctx->stateprefix) = 1;

while (...) {
...
SHA512((uint8_t *) ctx->stateprefix, ctx->state_bytes + sizeof(uint32_t),
ctx->rehash);
...
*(ctx->stateprefix) = *(ctx->stateprefix) + 1;
}

In other words, stateprefix will be some fixed value between 1 and a very
low number, maybe 100? In that case, it's simply a static value an attacker
can precompute and it will not take alot of memory.

Anyway, it's used in the phs_gen_output() function, so its called only
once. Improvement over defender will be low.
