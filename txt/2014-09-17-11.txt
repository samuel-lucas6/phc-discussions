However, AntCrypt, OmegaCrypt, and Schvrch all tried to introduce data
based branching for GPU defense, and "cyclomatic complexity". I am
not sure we've seen this idea implemented well yet, and data-based
branching has been considered a no-no for years apparently. However,
when 3 authors all invent the same thing, I think we should take a
closer look.

This is why we see these submissions.

P.S. Schvrch is not in this category. As it is not an actual branch. In x86 SIMD
you do a compare then xor (compare sets it to all 1s or all 0s). With GPUs, they
would set a conditional variable (compare) then conditionally run bitwise invert
(one instruction). Note that a branch in x86 takes two instructions compare and
conditional jump. Both SIMD and GPUs use two instructions with neither being a
jump.
