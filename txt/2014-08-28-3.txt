1st it is relatively easy to allocate non-cacheable memory (comparing to
keeping everything in cache). It is not portable but it seems that every
major OS supports that option.

1. imagine the documentation saying "and you need to allocate
non-cached memory from the OS". most of the time we don't even
allocate memory, we let the runtime environment do it.

2. testing is a bit problematic. how do you test if it is cached? you
attempt timings?

3. what about virtual OSs? i don't think the host OS respects such requests.
