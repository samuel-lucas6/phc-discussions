If the attacker can obtain a shell under the same uid as the webapp
process and go undetected for a while, then he can ptrace the webapp and
see the passwords as they're being passed into the hashing function.

It does not work this way anymore. At least not on modern Linux
distributions that enable the Yama LSM, which I'm pretty sure all
distributers started doing ~ 3 years back.

I believe FreeBSD also limits ptrace functionality through MAC policies,
but I am unsure of whether it is disabled by default.

I cannot speak to other operating systems.
