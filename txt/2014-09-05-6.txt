I am too lazy and rushed right now to
compute the probability that, by generating random 1000-bit integers,
you hit a value whose largest prime factor is less than 2^80, but it
is negligible (less than 1 in 2^200).

Approximating Dickman's rho as u^-u, the probability that a randomly-selected 1000-bit integer is 2^80-smooth is
rho(log(2^1000)/log(2^80)), or roughly 2^-45.

That said, I agree that worrying about safe primes in unwarranted. By all measures, cycling and p+-1 attacks are a
terrible factorization method for general numbers; any serious attacker will be better served by trying ECM or the
number field sieve.

I recommend Rivest and Silverman's 1999 paper on this precise subject, specifically Section 9:
