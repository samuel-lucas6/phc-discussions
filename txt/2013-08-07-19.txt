The general idea is that you don't keep everything in memory
you're supposed to, but only an occasional checkpoint. From
this checkpoint you can recompute memory near it. Often it's
a good choice to keep sqrt(n) checkpoints from which you can
recompute any value you're interested in in time n/sqrt(n)=sqrt(n).

Nope. Anyways rainbow tables are around "n^(2/3)" time and space.

For this it usually takes x times longer for n/x memory.
