I'll buy the first argument, but not the second.

However, given the current threat situation, the first argument is
on the books with a near-nill value in my ledger:  Most surveillance
these days is persistent.

The second argument I don't buy at all, because I don't think we
want to mandate client participation, and if we don't, there has
to be a way for a client to say "no can do", and guess what: The
bad boys will always do that.

I agree with that, but in my mind mandating client participation
cuts a LOT of usability from the algorithm, so it is not a step
I'm willing to take for slight gains.

Well, the clever thing that's always available, so to communicate
the the salt to the user over a secure channel and tell them to
write it down for later use.

That opens the floodgates to using the same password for one-time-auth
over unsecure channels (server issued nonce hashed with output of
PHC_winner(password))  but that is more of a protocol thing than a
PHC submission feature.
