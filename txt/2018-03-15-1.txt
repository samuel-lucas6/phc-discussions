What I am looking for would be exactly like a Bloom filter in concept, but

the filter;

Is anyone aware of any work involving such tradeoffs?

And if not, where would be the right place to ask this question? Would the
"passwords" list be any more likely to have this answer? :-)

I wouldn't expect the "passwords" list to be any more likely to have the
answer, but feel free to try asking in there as well, if you include
your explanation of the use case relevant to passwords and perhaps refer
to this thread for what's already been discussed.  You can refer to this
thread via:

(The thread is broken in a few places perhaps because some of the
messages were off-list, hence linking to the day rather than the thread.)
