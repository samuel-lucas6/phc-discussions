Some of the authors, like EARWORM, listed everything he
could think of, and I have nothing so far to add, but probably half of
the ones I've read so far didn't list any weaknesses at all, and so I
have a list...

Thank you - this is high praise :-). I felt a bit sheepish submitting
informally-stated conjectures for some claims that I felt ought to be
backed by theorems, but seeing that even some of my favorite designs are
supported by far less analysis alleviates my impostor syndrome considerably.
