Hi Krisztian,

The main strength of Argon is the penalty it imposes on any memory-saving
attacker. If you afford only half of memory, the time complexity grows at
least 90-fold.  We hope that the new text on wiki clarifies that.

We removed all vague statements, as 'simple' is indeed to subjective.

Best regards,
Dmitry

simple compared to what? certainly not simple compared to pbkdf2, or

Fast with AES-NI (five-round AES)

what does that mean? why do we care how fast it is if we plan to run
it for 100ms anyway? what is "with" here? aes-ni is a prerequisite of
fastness? or cause? what is the point?

if the strengths section will continue to contain such vague and adhoc
