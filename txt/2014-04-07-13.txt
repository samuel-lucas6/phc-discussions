Subject: Argon V1

Hi all,

we have found a bug in the function that produced Reed-Muller codewords for
the SubGroups transformation in Argon, which resulted in two duplicate
entries in the matrix L.

>From the security perspective, the bug does not affect collision/preimage
resistance or avalanche properties, but allows an adversary to save 12.5%
of memory in all tradeoff attacks with the same penalty factor. For
instance, when you attack the 128-MB computation with 56 MB of RAM (instead
of expected 64 MB), you get the penalty factor of 160.  Apart from that, no
cryptanalytic vector is identified.

We have fixed it, produced a new matrix, and made a new reference document
titled Argon v1:
https://www.cryptolux.org/images/0/0c/Argon-v1.pdf

The reference implementation can be found at
https://github.com/khovratovich/Argon/tree/master/Argon-Reference

All the relevant documents have been also sent to the Committee.

If you have been cryptanalysing Argon v0, it is quite likely that your
results apply to Argon v1 as well.
