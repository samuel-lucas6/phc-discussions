Cool!

One note: since we're doing two PMULUDQ, and they cannot be dispatched
in the same cycle, the lower bound for the latency of any accurate
emulation is 6 cycles.

Good point.  However, when we have a sequence of multiple emulated
_mm_mullo_epi32()'s, this extra cycle may be incurred only once per
sequence rather than once per _mm_mullo_epi32().

It's similar to how the scalar widening MUL has (on some CPUs) 1 cycle
higher latency for edx (or rdx) than for eax (or rax).  In the table I
posted, I included the higher latency, but we may have in mind that in
some instruction sequences the lower latency will sometimes apply.
