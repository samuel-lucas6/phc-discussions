Hash: SHA1

I am going to personally give Parallel a qualified "A" grade, and
suggest to the judges that Parallel make it to the next round.

Do we have any graphics experts here who could chime in?

The competition has no other entry designed to make use of graphics
accelerators for defensive purposes.  Even our cell phones have
graphics hardware now days.  It seems crazy not to use these resources
for defensive purposes.  I would hate to see our only entry in this
category get dropped from the competition.

My only qualification is that I think SHA512 is a poor choice for hash
function, as is SHA256, Blake2b, SHA3, and every other cryptographic
hash.  Every one of these is designed for cheap and fast
implementation in an ASIC!

What I would like to see for Parallel is an effort to find a graphics
accelerator optimized hashing function which is hard to implement in
an ASIC.  I do not feel it needs to be a cryptographically strong
hashing function, just something that doesn't lose entropy and which
the attacker can't compute with short-cuts.  It should be difficult to
accelerate in an ASIC, so it probably needs to make parallel use of
the cores and memory commonly available on graphics accelerators.

Surely graphics experts could help us here.  I bet there are some
pretty awesome graphics-acceleration-hard solutions waiting to be
found that will simply trash ASIC attacks.

Without a graphics-card optimized hashing function option, I would
have trouble recommending that Parallel deserves to be one of the PHC
winners.  With such a function, I hope it will be.

I am willing to help with the ASIC defense analysis.  If there were a
graphics expert here I could work with, we might be able to help Steve
out.
