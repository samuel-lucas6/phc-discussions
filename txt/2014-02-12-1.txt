Having submitted my NoelKDF with it's multiplication compute-time

to spend matters at all.  An attacker will simply add password hashing
cores, which are close to free, to his FPGA or ASIC, until his memory
bandwidth is full.  If I force him to spend a full second to write and
then read 4GiB once (which I do), he'll just run 5 of my hashing cores
in parallel on an FPGA and fill it's 40GiB/sec memory bandwidth, doing
5 guesses per second, so who cares that I forced him to spend as long
as me computing the hash?

Now the reverse is not true - if we spend time on a complex hash
function instead of filling memory rapidly, an attacker will be more
efficient, maxing out his memory bandwidth while we don't, and that
ration is pure win for the attacker.

Could you possibly run through that argument again, I think I'm missing
something (it's probably obvious but I can't see it at the moment).

â€‹My problem is understanding why memory bandwidth is the critical factor -
is memory bandwidth inherently more expensive than the actual DRAM?
