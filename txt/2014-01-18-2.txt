Do you suggest that aside from the theoretical side channel attack, and
under the assumption that the recomputation of the missing data is
computationally expensive, an attacker cannot achieve more than 2x speedup?

Yes, assuming an attacker's ASIC has the same bandwidth as the GPU.

I think that high end single-chip GPUs have memory bandwidths that are
nearly as high as is possible with current technology.  I have to add
weasel wording: there are ways to speed up ASICs I'm not thinking
about, like liquid nitrogen cooling, and area-array bonding pad
technologies that might make possible some insane number of pins on a
mega-bandwidth device.  However, I've never seen such beasts.  I'd
feel pretty good about using such a KDF.  It should protect against
anything other than exotic technologies that go beyond regular ASICs.

I mostly deal with older process technologies now days (90nm and
larger).  Someone more involved in the latest and greatest processes
should know more about what limits modern ASICs.
