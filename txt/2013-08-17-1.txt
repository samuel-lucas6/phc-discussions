Subject: Tweak to the call for submissions

After discussions between panel members, the PHC call now requires
that submission be able to produce 32-byte hash values (rather than
16-byte).

A motivation for this is to make sure that the hashing scheme can
directly be used for derivation of 256-bit keys.

I also added a clarification regarding the API:

"
The API should include, but may not be limited to, a function with the
following prototype:
int PHS(void *out, size_t outlen, const void *in, size_t inlen, const
void *salt, size_t saltlen, unsigned int t_cost, unsigned int m_cost);
The t_cost and m_cost arguments are intended to parameterize time and
memory usage, respectively, however this is not a strict requirement
(only one parameter may be effective, m_cost might affect time, etc.).
