Subject: gambit pseudo code


i kind of know that i'm exceeding my allowed email count per day. but
i just noticed that gambit pseudo code is on line.

at a glance, i mostly agree to it, and nice work. will check more
thoroughly later.

one observation. STR_TO_LE_ARRAY and LE_ARRAY_TO_STR assumes little
endian, but in fact the only thing that potentially cares about
endianness is the Trans function. otherwise, we just store and
restore, which is endian neutral.

not sure if it worth noted or something.
