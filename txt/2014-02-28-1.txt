That is probably the clearest and least ambiguous option. I don't like
"predictable" and "pseudorandom", those terms don't need more overloads.
For the sake of bike-shedding, I propose "silent" and "noisy".

I had to look up bike shedding.  This is definitely a bike shedding opportunity.

I could get behind "silent" and "noisy".  That's better than my
original "pure" and "dirty".

How about "stealthy" and "noisy"?  Stealthy sounds cooler.  Definitely
a bike shed moment...
