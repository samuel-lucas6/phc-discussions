I've waited awhile after seeing this but I'm still just getting a blank page,
is there supposed to be content there?  I was curious to compare the final
version with my code, which is (in part):
 >
	/* Process the numeric string */
	for( value = 0, i = 0; i < strLen; i++ )
		{
		const int valTmp = value * 10;

It's hard to guarantee it without seeing a full program but this 
multiplication very much looks like a signed integer overflow which is 
undefined behavior (UB).

		const int ch = byteToInt( str[ i ] ) - '0';
>
		if( ch < 0 || ch 9 )
			return( CRYPT_ERROR_BADDATA );
		if( value >= ( MAX_INTLENGTH / 10 ) || \
			valTmp >= MAX_INTLENGTH - ch )
			return( CRYPT_ERROR_BADDATA );
		value = valTmp + ch;
		if( value < 0 || value MAX_INTLENGTH )
			return( CRYPT_ERROR_BADDATA );
		}

The last check seems to be superfluous or at least ineffective. If 
"value" is overflown UB is already triggered. To put it another way 
optimizing compilers will probably remove it anyway. Are you compiling 
without optimizations?
