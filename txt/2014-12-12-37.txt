If you compare the observed hash rates to the available EC2 VMs or GCE VMs,
you'll probably find a very close match.

"YeScrypt Mining Rigs for Rent", 9 are listed right now (one is rented,
8 available).  Hash rates are unimpressive.  They range from 500 to 5000;
the latter would correspond to a 6-core CPU or similar, assuming that
this is BSTY.
