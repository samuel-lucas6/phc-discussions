Not communication - I actually confused bits and bytes there.  Thank you
for spotting this!

So by these estimates a 32x32->64 multiplier is equivalent to only a 512
bytes SRAM, which is lower than the estimates we had before.

This does in fact mean that using the multipliers on current CPUs is
probably not worth it in terms of increasing attack ASIC die area, even
when we're only using L1 caches and not L2+, nor RAM.

It might make more sense against attacks with other CPU-like devices,
some of which might be smaller than the defender's (or have relatively
fewer multipliers per L1 cache size) - e.g., a botnet of smartphones.
