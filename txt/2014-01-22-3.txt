This reduced the 25% coverage attack to 24.5X penalty for a 1% cheat

pebble coverage, and the penalty dropped to 0.88X for my 1% pass.

What is meant by a penalty of 0.88X?

Oh, I guess this is 0.88X on top of the normal effort (non-TMTO),
meaning a 1.88X increase in total effort (for both loops combined).

Actually, I am surprised.  I thought the penalty would be less, if it's
just for the 1% pass and not also for the lookups needed during the
memory filling pass (why aren't you counting those?)

What penalties are you getting for 50% coverage?  Are they comparable to
my results here? -

Yes, these were for a different anti-TMTO approach - with random writes
rather than random reads while filling memory - yet there's similarity.
