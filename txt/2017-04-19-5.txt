Subject: Re: [PHC] Fwd: memory-hard password hashing

It is precisely vertcoin's experience with botnets that would lead me to
want a GPU-friendly solution instead.   Represents a middle-ground.
"Lyra2RE" seems to be GPU-friendly, but also not sufficiently ASIC
resistant.

Maybe something that uses parallel FLOPs might be ideal for maximizing GPU
utility.   Sequential memory-hard operations seem to target CPUs in a way
that would not be ideal in situations where botnet attacks are a concern.

Personally I think "GPU friendly" is not a great thing for passwords,
since GPUs are asymmetrically more popular with attackers, but you might be
interested in checking out the "Vertcoin" project: https://vertcoin.org/

It's a cryptocoin, similar to Bitcoin, with the gimmick that they have
always tried to target the GPU mining audience.  Their proof of work
started out with an adaptive N scrypt algorithm, but when KnC released
scrypt ASICs, they pivoted to a modified Lyra2, at which point a large
botnet took control of most of the mining power, and they pivoted again
with a Lyra2 more finely tuned for modern GPUs.

I think the ideal goal for password algorithms is CPU friendly, where the
most efficient machinery for calculating the hash is a commodity CPU.  At
that point, you could roll your own ASICs, but they wouldn't be much better
than what you could just pick up at Best Buy, and you'd lose out on the
economies of scale that CPU vendors have.
