My TwoCats password hashing scheme is a lot of fun, and I am beginning

However, it's complexity is it's biggest drawback.  For guys who just
want some simple memory hashing, and don't need all the security
features I included TwoCats, a simple KISS memory hashing function
might be better.

Good idea.

Is it a problem if I make two submissions?  The second would be  a
tiny stripped down version of TwoCats with only a memory size
parameter.  Maybe SkinnyCat, or some such thing, though both my cats
are on the heavy side.

It's OK to make two submissions, but the reason you give is not good
enough for that, in my opinion.  Instead of making two submissions, can
you define TwoCats and SkinnyCat such that SkinnyCat can be computed
with TwoCats?  That way, SkinnyCat will be an implementation of a subset
of the functionality of TwoCats, and it can be part of the same
submission.  Just a cut-down implementation included in the submission,
and maybe also a second specification document for the cut-down version.

That said, in case we'd happen to want to include SkinnyCat but not
TwoCats in the PHC portfolio, I'm not sure how we'd approach that if
it's not submitted separately.  I guess we'd ask you to package it
separately at that time.

What do others think?
