Subject: A must read...

It always bears repeating that the password-cracking attacker typically has many candidate guesses he can try in parallel, and usually has many hash values he wishes to target. How do you prevent him from hiding latencies in long pipelines? (longer than those that would be tolerable in defenders' branch-happy general purpose systems)

A must read for those who haven't seen it before:
