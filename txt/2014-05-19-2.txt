Unless I am mistaken, it can be done in 2log N. You first look at the first
row with the binary search, find maximal X' <= X, and then do the same for
the column where X' is.

I was challenged with a puzzle yesterday, but I don't believe the
guy offering the puzzle understands the solution very well.  Once I
understood his puzzle (which took me a while - I can be slow), I
gave him the optimal solution, running in O(N), in about 10 seconds.

A optimal runtime of O(N) for a NxN matrix sounds legit. :-)

Good work! :)

He didn't seem to like it, so we moved into highly unoptimal
territory, and before giving up on the discussion, he pressed me on
how long I though his preferred solution would take, "in my gut".  I
stuck to O(N*log2(N)).

Yep. The algorithm proposed by devendraiiit  runs in O(N * log(N)).

He was clearly unimpressed.  I'm giving myself kudos for sticking
with my gut, which turned out to be exactly right, but only if I give
the guy the benefit of the doubt and improve his algorithm slightly -
doing a binary search on the diagonal, rather than picking the middle
element.  I simply couldn't accept that he was advocating picking the
middle element and then recursing on 3 N/2xN/2 sub-matricies...
that's just nuts.  Here's a link to an online discussion of the
puzzle I found today:

Starting from the element A[N/2][N(2] looks like a good idea since you
only need about O(N) steps to find any element, i.e, the distance from
A[N/2][N(2] to the target Value is at most N/2.

BTW. The idea of using binsearch on the diagonal is pretty cool. :-)

I soon as I read the problem description I also came up with a recursive

Lets try the O( N + log(N)) algorithm where you start at A[1][1].
Lets assume that we are looking for an element X which is not on the
diagonal. Then we run down the diagonal until A[i][i]  X.
then we know X must be i the left bottom or the right top corner.

Then we take a close look at the NxN matries with the diagonal
(A[1][i-1],...A[i-1][N]) and (A[i+1][1],...A[N][i+1]).

And so on and so forth, until we got the element.
