PHC makes sense for pswds at rest on the server.  But...

May I assume that if the pswd is hashed client side, two conditions need to be true: 1) javascript or other hashing support is available, and 2) the hash is passed in a secure tunnel?  If no tunnel, what's the difference between sending the hash and cleartext to anyone monitoring traffic?  

For transit, it seems to all come down to a tunnel.  And if a tunnel, how authenticated?  How can we be sure/guarantee the client can auth the server?  ...or is there something I'm missing?
