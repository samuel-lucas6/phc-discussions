The only way to prevent users from picking bad passwords is to pick
memorable but secure passwords for them. Something like Diceware. Of
course that will annoy users. So it's certainly not a perfect
solution, but it's the only way to prevent the clever idiot from
finding a way to get a bad password past the strength ruleset. It also
has the advantage that you know the entropy of the passwords, so it's
easier to tune the defenses appropriately. If only it weren't
completely unusuable with real users!

Are there any candidates that use the password, or password derived data, at
any point to derive the memory access pattern?  For example, does the
password get mixed-in in any way and then the result used to determine the
memory access pattern?

If the memory access pattern is completely invariant of the password then I
