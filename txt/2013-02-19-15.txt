@Larry,

That makes perfect sense to me but I don't understand the addendum about
network byte order.

What does network byte order mean in the context of a C Language array in
storage?  Is that the same as ordering in[0], in[1], ..., in[inlen-1] and,
with regard to accepting serial input from a byte stream, the array is
filled with the first arrival at in[0], the second at in[1], etc.?

I assume this is the mapping that is also sensible with regard to how digest
algorithms are specified in terms of storage blocks.  (If there is a
big-/little-endian assumption on framing these into multi-byte logical
words, that is for the interior of the implementation to deal with, in my
understanding.)

Is there something that I am missing in what you are saying?

 - Dennis

In PHS(), we deal with bytes.

+1

...and said bytes/byte strings/byte arrays should be specified to be in
network byte order.
