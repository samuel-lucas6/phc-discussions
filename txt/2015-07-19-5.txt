I am underestimating the ASIC cost in the extreme case where a buyer buys
many millions of dollars worth.  A lot of the pricing depends on volume.
They'd have to buy many millions of dollars worth to get the best pricing,
but I suppose BitCoin mining might support that.

High bandwidth ASICs and the systems they go into are tricky.  For example,
Achronix only sells their FPGAs to a few big customers.  You can't buy
one.  When you have 10 GiB/s I/O pins, you can't just let anybody try to
build a board using them.  Instead you have to get involved with the
customer in their board design.  I heard that the Rocket I/O project at
Xilinx slowed down their FPGA development to a point that it did major
damage to the company, and these I/Os are 3X slower than the Achronix I/Os
per pin.

I think DRAM pricing shows a good example of how cheap high bandwidth
devices can be.  The highest bandwidth devices are quite a bit more
expensive.  It is not clear how much the actual RAM costs vs the I/Os in
these parts.
