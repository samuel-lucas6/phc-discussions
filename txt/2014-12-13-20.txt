I think you are saying this would be slower, take more storage than the
method I describe.  Do you see some advantage?

In my method, the user needs not know the factorization of n at any
point. This means that n can be shared by all users; the 300 blinding
pairs can be shared as well. Thus, they can be hardcoded in the
application, without requiring per-user storage of such data.


I think your method loses information theoretic security because the 
way you generate the blinding factor has number of values 
c(300,150)<|n|.  With my method b is uniform random from [0,n).

Ah, I see: the _delegation_ is information-theoretic secure. However,
if the attacker can get a copy of the resulting hash value (the
classic situation with a server authenticating user against a
database of hashed passwords), then we are back to "normal" security
(if you know the factorization of n, you can compute square roots
modulo n).
