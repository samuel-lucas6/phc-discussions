Note I believe there might be a problem with some of it: battcrypt on 5x and
POMELO on 3x and 5x. Since those algorithms don't have t_costs for those and

think they are run at lower settings.

But ignoring that these are the best benchmarks I've seen since they're
normalized for rounds across memory and time vs memory (instead of having
t_cost
or m_cost as an axis).

Cool! Why are these for t_cost from 2 to 5, though? Where's t_cost 0
and 1?

2x to 5x are how many passes are done over memory (ignoring the initialization
of memory). This is what I came up with here:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/2550

This was just my attempt at coming up with useful settings to compare algorithms
and Milan Broz was awesome enough to run them.


I think only behavior with the lowest supported t_cost matters
for selection of a scheme, whereas exactly how higher t_cost affects the
behavior is merely additional information to be used for fine-tuning.

Yes but using minimum t_cost has problems because some algorithms aren't memory
hard at those levels. I assume when the winner is picked we'll have minimum
settings that aren't broken. I personally think that any setting that allows for
TMTO is broken. Thus why I started at 2x. Also there are multiple because
battcrypt, POMELO, and Pufferfish don't use t_cost linearly. Well yescyrpt too
but that's just the first two that are weird.
