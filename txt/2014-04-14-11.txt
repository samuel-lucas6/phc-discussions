    Before throwing the baby out with the bathwater I would suggest
    getting in touch with Casper and Darren who are still at that
    company and might be able to give you some insight into the patent.
    I left Sun in 2009 when Sun got bought out, but back then the plan
    was to make it patented but not enforced, ie: to stop some bad guy
    doing the same and blocking out the Internet community.

    ideas from SunMD5 ("rounds=N" in the cipher, etc) because Casper (if
    I remember correctly?) participated in that process with RedHat.
      I'll cc: them on this mail. I don't know whether if then reply
    whether it would bounce?

I read the patent.  Every claim depends on building a system that can
support new hashing algorithms without changing source code, and instead
only configuration files.  This is a great idea, but having to recompile
to support new algorithms isn't all that bad.  For one thing, it allows
us to use enumerated types in the interface for selection of the
algorithm, while we'd have to use strings otherwise.

That was the intent of the patent because recompiling is a big deal for 
systems that are not open source - and even sometimes those that are. 
There was no intention to patent the SunMD5 password hash itself so I 
wouldn't expect any claims about it in the patent.

At the time this was developed for Solaris which was closed source, much 
much later an implementation of this became available under the CDDL as 
part of OpenSolaris.  You can find a copy of that implementation in the 
Illumos git hub source here:
