   P.S. MD5("deliciously-salty-" || pw) is from an infamous article that

 Joking aside, if you have a unique "deliciously-salty-", truncate the MD5 to
24 bits, and implement a good rate limiting system you'd probably have a
pretty secure system. Good enough against online attacks, but not so good that
you are giving up someone's password if you leak hashes. [weak passwords are
still weak, and leaks from multiple sources for the same UID would eventually
give up a password]


Wait, I don't even know why I argued that way. I can't think of one case where a
severely truncated hash equals more security. Oh wait does my keyboard have a
breathalyzerâ€”nope.
