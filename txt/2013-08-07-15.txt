I should say I'm mostly thinking of the case of a website/server login.

 What problems?

      and extra resources.
 
 Like multiple CPU cores?


Creating/destroying threads is costly (time and memory). You can avoid some of
this overhead if you have a service/daemon running and take requests.


      If anything it should be nice for vector instructions (SSE2, AVX,
   AVX2, AVX512)
 
 How would these help leverage multicore CPUs?


It won't but the multiple concurrent requests to login will.


      Anyone know if the AES-NI run in constant time?
 
 It'd be pretty facepalm if it wasn't. That said AES-NI would be an
interesting way to get speedups on x86 CPUs at least

I agree but I don't like to assume.
