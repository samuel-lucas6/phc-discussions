Oops... you were just replying to my email.  I haven't added any strengths
bullets yet for Gambit, but if you don't mind, I'll add:

Simplifies password hashing with sponge construction

Any list of strengths would seem incomplete without it.  I would also add
that simplicity of analysis and resulting security are strengths.  Should
there be others listed?
