Subject: Stupid Friday thoughts

We had friends over for a wonderful Friday happy hour, and my wife, a
diehard Dukie, is in heaven after the scary 1-point win.  There was
beer and wine all around.

So, that explains this super-lame post.

This password hashing thing has been an amazing amount of fun.  I
haven't had a chance to interact with people this smart since leaving
Silicon Valley in 2000.  I just want to say thanks to the amazing
geeks on this list.

Bill
