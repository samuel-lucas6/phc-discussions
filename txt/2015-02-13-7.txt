Hi, everyone.

Sorry for the delay in answering: it was a long day today spent on
meetings...

We will upload both v1 and v2 in our website (http://lyra-kdf.net/) and
do the same on eprint (something like submitting v1 and just after that
submitting v2, so we have both in history). We will soon email the
eprint links for easy reference.

Regarding Lyra(2), aren't the versions that you considered archived on
http://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/versions.pl?entry=2014/030
or
http://lyra-kdf.net/
?

(Jakob responded for Catena.)

To avoid confusion, the PHC webpage only links to the latest version.
