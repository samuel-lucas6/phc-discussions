I came up with similar categories:
* Script language friendly
* Dynamic s-box "Bcrypt style"
* Cache timing resistant "Catena style"
* Heavy ROM use "PHS for auth servers"

* Divergent code

* Random block access "Scrypt style"
* Other "Other"

Oh shoot I forgot about divergent code.

Disclosure: I submitted battcrypt and Parallel.
