It is precisely vertcoin's experience with botnets that would lead me to
want a GPU-friendly solution instead.   Represents a middle-ground.

yescrypt's ROM was also motivated in part by the threat of botnets.  You
don't need to go for GPUs for botnet resistance - you can use and depend
on a lot of RAM instead (more than you'd expect in most botnet nodes in
a few years' time).  Putting more RAM into servers doesn't have as many
drawbacks as putting GPUs in there.
