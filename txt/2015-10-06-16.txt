If you support C++11 then you should be perfectly fine with our C++11
implementation, as it needs no external libraries (except for Blake2).

If you don't then a single-thread implementation can be easily derived from
either C++11 or C99 implementations.

Not me, but: would this mean the code would then not build at all
without autoconf?  If so, that's a drawback that we should try to avoid.
Not every project that might want to embed an Argon2 implementation will
be autoconf'ed (nor will want to be).

Just to give everyone an example of the above mentioned problem:

I'm sure the Crypto++ project will strongly oppose requiring anything
beyond standard libraries (including OpenMP) [1].
So if the code forces other libraries to use AutoConf, this code can't
be included in Crypto++ and we (= the Crypto++ team) have to code Argon2
from scratch which I think is highly undesirable for all parties.
