Subject: [PHC] Fwd: memory-hard password hashing

There is a focus on memory-hard algorithms in password hashing, since that
renders them ASIC/GPU resistant.

However, it is /possible/ for an ASIC to be tightly coupled with DRAM in
ways that can exceed PC memory performance.

Instead, is there an algorithm that is "very GPU friendly"?

GPU's are cheap, common and highly optimized for certain operations in ways
that make the construction of ASICs that beat them at what they are best at
very unlikely.   They are, essentially, "floating point matrix operation
ASICs".

Yes, this means that servers using such a mechanism may want to have GPUs
installed to reduce hashing times and allow a larger number of operations
to increase hashing security.   But I think this is a reasonable request
for many applications.

If it takes 10 milliseconds to compute a single hash with highly parallel
FLOPs on a modern GPU, that affords a massive amount of security for a hash
- ASIC resistant in ways that memory-hard algorithms cannot be.

Is there an algorithm that already lends itself to this kind of application?
