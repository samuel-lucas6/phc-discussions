Thank you all for the suggestions and criticism!

You can use it in SIV-like deterministic encryption mode to avoid nonce collisions and add authentication:

iv = HMAC(Key, "yescrypt-encryption-IV" || passwordHash || salt)
encryptedPasswordHash = iv || (PBKDF2(Key, iv) XOR passwordHash)

To decrypt, generate PBKDF2 stream using the prepended IV, then XOR it with encryptedPasswordHash, generate IV with result and compare it with the attached IV.

A major drawback is that this would require storage of the IVs along
with the hashes.  That's a significant increase in storage requirements.

Simplest scheme would be SHA-256 in the counter mode.

Just XOR SHA-256(Key||Nonce||0..0)||SHA-256(Key||Nonce||0..01) to the block[4], that's it.

This relies on having a nonce, which is something I am trying to avoid.

We do already have salts, which are preferably unique and could be
reused, but as I mentioned before I'd like not to increase reliance on
them being unique.
