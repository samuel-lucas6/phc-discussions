Hi, I'm new here but I already see comments like:

Well, I just said I'd hold off picking on poor AntCrypt, since it's
not the guy's fault he picked a name starting with A, but...

Apologies to the author... sorry, you were at the top of the list.


I have a horse in the race too (Omega Crypt) but I want to see designs
evaluated and attacked.  If that means my design gets torn to shreds so
be it.  It's very important everything that needs to be said about a
proposal is said.

Security never has been about rainbows and unicorns.  It sucks to see
something you've worked hard on broken or criticized but that's the way
it has to be if we want to learn about all of the security implications
of a particular design.

So as long as you're being professional and attacking the *design* and
NOT the *author* don't hold back.

If you're concerned about picking on the AntCrypt author then skip
ahead from A to O or some other letter :-)

Brandon
