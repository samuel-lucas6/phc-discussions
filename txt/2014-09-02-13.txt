I think Bill missed the point about Schvrch *big* time.

Cryptography is at its foundation about finding ways to mix up
bits, to make them unrecognizable without loosing their entropy.

Once you dive into it, the actual palette of tools at our disposal 
is much smaller than most people realize, and many of those tools 
are even specific variants of more general tools from the same 
palette.

Schvrch adds an entirely new tool to the palette -- no mean feat.

I have no idea how Bill could overlook this, but my guess is that 
the compactness of what was proposed and the lack of orthodox 
encryption primitives deceived him into not paying proper
attention.

He should.

Schvrch was one of the submissions which made PHC worth the effort
for me.

Schvrch's mathematical pedigree lists both Von Neumann[1] and 
Wolfram, both were fascinated and frustrated by the seemingly 
unlimited complexity arising out of trivially simple rules.

That of course is no guarantee of cryptographic utility.  Only
time and analysis will tell if Schvrch's new tool is any good.

But Bills dismissal of mathematics which frustrated both Von
Neumann and Wolfram as "just XORs states together" and concluding
that "not much effort went into it" is not even wrong.

[1] The paper inexplicably fails to credit him.

I am not dismissing the mathematics.

I am only carefully reviewing the *code*.  The Schvrch attached paper
(not the actual submission for the PHC) may be wonderful, but I have
not read it.  If the point is to show a new mathematical system for
hashing, then yes, I missed it.  I though the point was to write a
secure hash function :-)

However, a new mathematical hashing framework is cool.  If the author
would work with guys who understand a bit about password hashing, he
might come up with a great algorithm.  However, he clearly did not,
and Schvrch does nothing to defend against common attacks.  Unlike
other authors on the list (POMELO for example), the Schvrch author did
not seem interested in hearing about how to fix his algorithm from
this list.  That's why I said we should just skip it.
