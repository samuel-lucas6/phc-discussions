Judging from our graphs you might have confused the instances of
Catena. Catena-DBG should require about 1.5 times the size of
Catena-BRG and it does so in our tests. Also Catena and Catena-BRG
should be absolutely equal in all categories.


I do not think so, you can check it in hash_libs dir. The makefile compiles only
required sources - for dbg catena-DBG.o for brg catena-BRG.o.

But I think the problem is that for submitted Catena I used minimal mcost value 18.
(Lower values without patch fails.)
(IOW direct comparison of Catena and Catena-BRG on graph is not possible now,
there are different baseline parameters.)

And there is logaritmic scale (so better to check raw output), but I really do not
see 1.5 times the size between Catena-DBG and Catena-BRG. How did you measure memory use?
I use getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF) on forked process.

But it is possible I did something wrong of course...

Thanks,
Milan
