I think this idea pre-dates Gambit, or do I miss something?

for me, the idea of xoring instead of overwriting came so naturally, i
don't even consider it an idea. in fact, it was like that in the first
draft. then i realized it might be unnecessary, and considered simple
overwrites. but i discovered a weakness of it, so i put xoring back.
