Taking client-independent updates out of the equations seems reckless
in most scenarios. You would basically put an expiration date on the
password hashes.

expiration yes, but it is not reckless. it is merely an inconvenience.
and we are not talking about months here. we are talking about years.
so the downside is passwords will expire after a year or two, and the
user must proceed with the forgotten password routine. i don't think
it is that bad.
