The second approach (allowing learning from each other and major tweaks)
might be beneficial due to a relatively small size of the community behind PHC
and due to state of the art being immature yet (the competition process clearly
 gave it a large boost), but then it needs to be applied to all the candidates.
In particular, given the state of other finalists, we believe that it
would be fair to keep Argon2i and Argon2d in the competition.

I totally agree with Dimitry on this topic. The PHC committee should (at
least reconsider to) keep Argon2i and Argon2d in the competition. From
my understanding, the idea behind this competition is to improve our
knowledge and password hashing schemes as much as possible.


Best regards,
Christian
