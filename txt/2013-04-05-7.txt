Formally, the right tool here is to ask for a proof that the construction is
indifferentiable from a random oracle -- assuming that the building blocks
(underlying hash functions, block ciphers, etc.) also meet similar criteria.

The submitters don't have to write this proof, but it would be one of the
criteria for analysis. Since most of these functions will probably be based on
'standard' building blocks, this shouldn't be an enormous stretch.

The changes between PBKDF1 and PBKDF2 are interesting WRT differentiability-from-RO, particularly length extension and image shrinkage.
