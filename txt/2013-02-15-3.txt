To what extent is it fair to write "the PHC grew out of discussion from #passwords12" ?

Disclaimer: I was not at Passwords^12, at least not physically. ;-)

I think it mostly did not, although Passwords^12 has helped get some of
the panel members involved.

I think JP's interest in running this competition and his prior
experience with the SHA-3 competition played a bigger role.  Without
that, we would probably not be having a competition (although some of us
would probably propose new password hashing schemes in 2013-2015
anyway - just fewer and without this competition process).
