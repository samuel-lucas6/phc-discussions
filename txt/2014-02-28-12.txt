Adjustable parameters will help, but how will proposed algorithms faire against future GPUs?

By considering ASICs, we also consider future GPUs and the like.
We might or might not have specific anti-future-GPU measures (and you're
right that adjustable parameters make it much more likely that we will),
but even if we don't they won't perform better than ASICs.

Speaking of adjustable parameters, I think they primarily enable better
use of future defenders' systems, which is important to reduce the
advantage of ASICs as well as future GPUs (or whatever other devices
would otherwise be best for attacks).
