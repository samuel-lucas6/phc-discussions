Hashing defense is latency cost multiplied by password complexity. You
need both the latency to be high on adversary hardware, and the password
complexity to be high, before you can defend against a targeted offline
attack.

That's an assumption that many people make, but it isn't actually true if
you interrelate password hashes so they need to be checked together (as we
did in the PolyPasswordHasher scheme). Multiple passwords protect a secret
that obscures all of the hashes.  This makes it so that groups of passwords
must be checked together and all must be correct to learn if any were
correct.   By forcing an attacker to guess many passwords simultaneously,
even if you have an attacker that knows a list of all passwords, but
doesn't know the distribution, the time to crack passwords is substantial.
 (Note: I'm assuming the ICB technique from the paper is turned off for
this discussion / analysis.)

For example, suppose you create a password database with all of the RockYou
passwords.  Also, suppose a strong attacker model where the attacker knows
the exact set of chosen passwords, but doesn't know which user chose each
password.  Thus, they know the password 'letmein' appears thousands of
times, but they do not know for which accounts.  Even with this it will
take millions of years of CPU time to guess a correct set of 5 passwords,
since they must simultaneously guess all passwords correctly before knowing
if any are right or wrong.
