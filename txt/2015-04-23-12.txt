I'm with Thomas on this.  It is futile for PHC candidates to fully
protect the password length.  (They should, however, make their running
time _mostly_ independent of password length, and Milan's benchmarks
confirm that they do.)


I agree.  Hiding password length from a power rail analysis seems to be a
lost cause.  It sounds like Krisztián Pintér may not agree, and might look
into protecting the password length in Gambit.  It would be interesting to
see what his solution looks like.

I think the password length leakage is of similar importance as what Lyra2
leaks in cache timing during it's second phase, though cache timing data is
easier to get.  For off-line attacks, the password length is probably more
useful - not only can you speed up breaking passwords, but you can work on
short passwords first.  The mod operation in Argon2i is a minor issue, IMO,
because the password length leakage is already there, and the attacker is
able to do a power rail analysis.  You're already in big trouble in that
case.
