Joking aside, if you have a unique "deliciously-salty-", truncate the MD5
to 24 bits, and implement a good rate limiting system you'd probably have a
pretty secure system. Good enough against online attacks, but not so good
that you are giving up someone's password if you leak hashes. [weak
passwords are still weak, and leaks from multiple sources for the same UID
would eventually give up a password]
