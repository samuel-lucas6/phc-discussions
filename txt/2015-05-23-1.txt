Subject: optimized Parallel

Hi,

I don't know why Steve isn't posting this in here himself, but he
tweeted a few days ago that he produced an optimized implementation of
Parallel with SHA-256 as the underlying hash function.  (This is
slightly different from the PHC submission, which uses SHA-512, but
since Parallel is in the same category with PBKDF2, it's OK - not a
tweak.  The submission does mention that the hash function can be
changed.)

Steve - why did you choose to switch to SHA-256 for this, though?

<Sc00bzTFinally got around to finishing an optimized version of Parallel. I'm getting 6.2 MH/s SHA256 on a Q9300:

<@Sc00bzTOh right I still need to get around to writing the make file. Also it takes 12 CPU core-minutes to compile in VS2013

The code does indeed look optimized: includes interleaving and SIMD, all
the way up to AVX-512 with ternary logic intrinsics.
