Current plans for PasswordsCon is Las Vegas, August 5-6, and Trondheim
(Norway) on December 8-9. I've got many requests about doing something
similar in London and/or other cities, currently trying to find time,
money & people to do so.

PasswordsCon in Las Vegas will be in cooperation with, and in the same
location as BSidesLV. Not only do we expand into 2 tracks (offensive &
defensive), we'll have double the space and an even bigger audience to
reach out to. Additionally I wouldn't be surprised if there will be
gatherings like last year into the early morning were the main topic is
hash algorithms etc.

CFP & updated passwordscon.org should hopefully be ready in a few days.

Best regards,
Per

Hi Thomas,

PasswordsCon will indeed be the de facto place-to-be, however we don't
plan a formal presentation of each candidate by its designers: unlike
AES/SHA3, where most submissions came from well-funded academics, it's
unlikely that most PHC submitters can travel and talk about their
submission at a dedicated conference.

There may also be a presentation about PHC at DEFCON, as a way to
elicit feedback and contributions.

    When the candidates are all submitted and published (in less than two
    months now), where will they be discussed ? The AES and SHA-3
    competitions
    had dedicated conferences, where the candidates were discussed at
    length.
    Am I right to assume that Passwords (as in "http://passwordscon.org/")
    will play this role ? I.e. that this will be the "place to be" for
    PHC ?

    On a similar vein, will there be a dedicated time somewhere for
    submitters to "make their case" (e.g. 15 minutes for each submitter to
    explain with slides how marvellous their creation is) ?
