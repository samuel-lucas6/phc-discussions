Subject: Re: [PHC] Response to recent comments on Rig

The internal collisions being reported were known to us at the time of the
design of Rig, and were already handled as explained below. They are NOT a
threat to the security of Rig. We allow inputs to be of arbitrary lengths
in Rig. The first hash input contains the concatenation of password (pwd),
salt (s), 64-bit representation of number of iterations (n) and 64-bit
representation of output length. However, the number of iterations and
output length will be fixed for a specific implementation. We will still
allow variable length password and salt by design. The concern expressed
was for the situation when Rig(pwd_1, salt_1) = Rig(pwd_2, salt_2). To
ensure that such internal collisions do not become a concern, we take the
last hash input as the concatenation of the chaining value and counter along
with the salt and the value m=2^m_cost. On page 14 of our report, it is
mentioned that, "Even if one can find collisions in the first hash
calculations, the attacker can not use it unless the salt is also same."
This design choice will not allow the final outputs of Rig to collide with
effort better than birthday bound. There are few other points that are
raised in another mail and we will address them in couple of few days. We
wish to send a detailed report (along with a revised version of the doc and
code, containing more references as discussed in the mailing list, removal
of the typo etc.). This week, the Rig team members are preoccupied in some
other work and hence please expect the detailed answer by early next week.


Thanks & Regards

We would like to know which memory swapping algorithm is being
referred to in the above statement ? Catena takes two inputs,
hashes the concatenation of these two, and writes the result in
some location in the array. On the other hand, Rig does two
different memory overwrite operations. In the first one, we use
sequential XOR of the chaining variable with the value of the same
variable from the previous round at the same location. In the
second one, we XOR the chaining variable with the input variable
indexed by the bit-reversal permutation from the previous round.

I was wrong here, because I had not noticed your bug yet.  Your
suggested fix will not work.  To get it to work, you will need to do
what I though you were doing, and use Catena's trick to use one array
for KeySet instead of two.

This will overwrite the value in position j.  Later, for all values of
j where br(j) j, when you read from k[j] to compute k[br(j)], you
will read the value from the current row, when you meant to read the
value from the previous row.

Catena's trick is to realize that once you read from k[br(j)], you no
longer need to remember the value stored in k[br(j)].  Instead of
writing to k[j], write to k[br(j)], just like your submission does,
which is why I thought you were using this trick.
>
On the next row, instead of reading from k[br(j)], you need to read
from k[j], because the data is already stored in bit-reversal order.
You will also need to write to k[j], since that is the location no
longer needed.  You will need different code for the even vs odd row
updates, but it saves you from having to have two k arrays.

I recommend you use this trick and simply acknowledge it the code

I think you have an error in your security proof.

Look at the proof starting on page 16.  In the first line "E1", you
convert the probability that a value is stored from Pr(value at Pj is
stored) to i/m.  You simply assume that the probability of the value
being stored is proportional to the ration of values stored divided by
the total values, independent of any property of Pr.
>
If Pr were the identity permutation, an attacker simply needs one
memory location, and he can compute the entire row sequentially, with
no recomputations at all.  Clearly there needs to be some mathematical
property of Pr that we can depend on to avoid this.  A pebbling proof
like Catena's is needed here.
