I feel like I'm taking crazy pills... Oh wait "Parallel" is an algorithm
I submitted as the name suggests it's very parallel. Although battcrypt,
my other submission, doesn't have any parallelism I mentioned in the paper
that it would be good to add but didn't because it would add complexity.
Also it wouldn't help in PHP since you are using built-in functions for
encrypting with Blowfish. And if you wrote interlaced Blowfish in PHP it
would be much slower.

Sorry, Steve.  Big geeks trying to communicate with words... always
problematic, at least for me.
