Hi Jakob,

we have updated the classification document (including analysis
regarding to (weak) garbage-collector attacks -- (W)GCA).

See: https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881

Among other minor changes, the update includes:
1) Argon2d and Argon2i (as two instantiations of the finalist Argon2)
2) yescrypt now provides (W)GCA resistance under certain requirements
   depending on the input parameter

It is unclear from your description whether you think yescrypt provides
GC resistance at t 0 and/or g 0, and why.  Can you clarify?  You
first list t = 0 among requirements for yescrypt's GC resistance, and
then describe how things change at t 0 and/or g 0, but you seem to
never clearly state whether it's GC attack resistant at those settings.
(And there's a missing closing brace, but this doesn't affect meaning.)

On a related note, the tweaked yescrypt defines client-independent
updates, so you may check this in Table 2.

3) tables now differentiate between finalist/non-finalists
4) added motivation for (W)GCA attacks in the introduction
5) BLAKE2b-1 is added as hash function for Catena
6) BlaMka is added as permutation for Lyra2 (in brackets, since it is
   not fully analyzed yet and thus, not recommended as default
   instantiation by the authors of Lyra2)

Thanks,

Alexander
