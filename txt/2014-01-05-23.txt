however, those are not requirements.

The call for submissions says otherwise:

Submission Requirements
--------------------------------------

[...]

Initial security analysis

* Discussion of the security claims and usage constraints of the
proposed algorithm: For which usage scenarios do the designers claim
their algorithm secure, and when should it not be used?
* Discussion of the security of the algorithm, and its dependence on
the security of cryptographic primitives used by the algorithm.

Efficiency analysis

* Discussion of the performance of the scheme on the target platforms
(that is, mainstream software): expected speed of an optimized
implementation, ability to exploit modern CPUs features (SIMD or
multicore), etc.
* Discussion of the performance of the algorithm on platforms that may
be used for high-speed password cracking (ASIC, FPGAs, GPUs); if
possible, an argument why password-cracking on those platforms is not
quite cost-effective.
