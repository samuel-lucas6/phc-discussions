I only used the "HMAC construction" phrase because the discussion was about
using MACs instead of password hashing functions. A keyed password hash has
equivalent security and some extra benefits (eg Catena's scheme still
allows for client-independent updates of the stored hash.) Sorry if that
wasn't clear.

Of course, one can simply use an HMAC construction with any normal

data, like private keys. Some of the submissions explicitly support keyed
password hashing, and with others any secure HMAC scheme should work.
Using
a strong password hashing scheme with a key protects weak passwords, and
protects strong passwords even if the key is somehow leaked.

I think it's sad that, even on a crypto list, people still talk about
new uses of HMAC (that's a Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for
things that require properties beyond what a MAC provides and do not
require message authentication.

In this particular case, using HMAC-fancy-password-hash is extra

I agree that there's some value in using a keyed password hashing
function, and similar benefits can probably be obtained with a simple
composition of a password hash with a keyed PRF or even just a simple
encrypted password hash database.
