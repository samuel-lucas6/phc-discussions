Note I believe there might be a problem with some of it: battcrypt on 5x and
POMELO on 3x and 5x. Since those algorithms don't have t_costs for those and I
think they are run at lower settings.

But ignoring that these are the best benchmarks I've seen since they're
normalized for rounds across memory and time vs memory (instead of having t_cost
or m_cost as an axis).

Cool!  Why are these for t_cost from 2 to 5, though?  Where's t_cost 0
and 1?  I think only behavior with the lowest supported t_cost matters
for selection of a scheme, whereas exactly how higher t_cost affects the
behavior is merely additional information to be used for fine-tuning.

Also, are the Lyra2 results included here for 1 or 2 threads?

I assume the rest are for 1 thread?
