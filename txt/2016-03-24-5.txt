Don't hash the key length, but instead hash in the round number after
rather than before the key.  Since the round number is different for
each round whereas the key is fixed across all rounds, the round numbers
used for k1 can't (except for any one of them) be part of the longer k2.

Thinking of it some more, the exception may actually be important, still
allowing to attack the last 1 or 2 rounds.

Or not, since the computation in the previous rounds would be different.

So my proposed change isn't
as complete a mitigation as hashing in the key length would be.

Or maybe it is.

However, the very fact that this needs more thinking suggests it isn't
as good, except in terms of code simplicity.

So it may be a case of reasoning simplicity vs. code simplicity.
