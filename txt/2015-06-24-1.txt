Subject: The perfect overall winner?

Just some basic bike-shedding... What would you like to see in a perfect
winner?

For me, in a perfect world, Marcos' team, Christian's team, and Alexander
would help Dmitry's team in a couple of all-nighters to work out the
world's best password hashing algorithm.  I prefer Lyra2's hybrid
architecture and Argon2d's single-pass architecture.  I prefer Yescrypt's
array of defenses which make it solid in nearly every real-world
situation.  I prefer Catena's awesome password-hashing framework.  The best
algorithm is clearly a combination of these.
