If it is not too late, maybe addinng m_parallel to PHS() as a tweak...

I know it's not right for your use case, but for password hashing on a
server the parallelism would be external to PHS(), so maybe you can
simply have your own wrapper start multiple independent threads, for
independent password hashes computed with their own PHS() calls?  And
provide a chart showing throughput in requests/second vs. memory usage
(e.g. 128 KB to 128 MB), at the lowest supported t_cost and the maximum
number of concurrent threads supported in hardware (e.g. 8 on a
currently typical quad-core CPU).  I'd find such results helpful.

Thank you!

Alexander
