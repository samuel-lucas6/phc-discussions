The second approach (allowing learning from each other and major tweaks)
might be beneficial due to a relatively small size of the community
behind PHC
and due to state of the art being immature yet (the competition process
clearly
 gave it a large boost), but then it needs to be applied to all the
candidates.
In particular, given the state of other finalists, we believe that it
would be fair to keep Argon2i and Argon2d in the competition.

I totally agree with Dimitry on this topic. The PHC committee should (at
least reconsider to) keep Argon2i and Argon2d in the competition. From
my understanding, the idea behind this competition is to improve our
knowledge and password hashing schemes as much as possible.

Seconded.  I appreciate the panel's rational for not allowing Argon2.
However, it is a strong competitor.  It's not like we'll have a chance next
year to pick new winners.  Argon2d gives good competition to the main
memory-hard hashing area, and Argon2i is the only other potential
cache-timing resistant algorithm left in the competition other than Catena.
