Great, thanks.  Back on topic, my #1 request for PufferFish would be
having a 4KiB-ish block size with a user-defined repeat count, after
which it would be mixed with another 4KiB block.  This could L1-cache
compute-time harden the algorithm while being effective against GPUs,
couldn't it?  With a low repeat count, it could hash a lot of external
DRAM.  I like the simplicity, but busting out of L1 cache seems
problematic.

Sure, but then pufferfish would be similar to escrypt and TwoCats.

P.S.  My #1 request for Escript (sorry, again off topic) would be a
SkinnyCat-like stripped down version of the essence of your favorite
parts of the algorithm.  I got mine done in something like 30 hours,
so there's still time.

I intend to work on something like this much later, way after the PHC
submission deadline.  I think things like that - additional
implementations of portions of the functionality - can be added later,
including as far as PHC is concerned.  I've got better uses for the
remaining time before the submission deadline.
