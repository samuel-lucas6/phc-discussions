It is also a general convention of Science and other intellectual
fields, since at least the days of Confucius, to require clear
exposition from the proponent of any idea.

and if not present, point out the problem, and request re-submit.
there was plenty of time to ask for clarification.

i can't wait to see if this changed the outcome or not. if it did, it
creates a very uncomfortable situation.

the heart of the
problem is about implementation efficiency, in particular how the
defender's hardware (presumably a general purpose CPU) will be optimal
for implementation of attacks (economic optimality, see above).

this topic also came up a while ago. how do we know what kind of
hardware will we have in ten years? overoptimizing to one
architecture, against some other architectures can become obsolete
really fast.

Thus, quality of the reference implementation is a legitimate criterion
_among others_. And this is not a novelty; this has been the case for
all cryptographic competitions,

can you cite me an example? i'm almost sure that for example estream
did not do that.
