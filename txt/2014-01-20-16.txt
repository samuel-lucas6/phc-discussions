BTW, if I understood Catena's server relief design correctly, it looks
compatible with RFC 5802 (SCRAM), which I happened to have described in
my own words here (before I learned of the RFC):

Yes, it is indeed the same idea. I think we have to cite your work. :-)

Your protocol is a little bit more sophisticated since it offers
protection against passive adversaries.


For this algorithm to work, the server only needs H(Hs(password, salt)).
This is very nice if so, meaning that exact same standardized hash type
may be used for storage on the server both for SCRAM and for plaintext
logins (possibly over a secure tunnel).

Yes. This is nice. :-)
