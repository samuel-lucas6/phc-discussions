Subject: Test vectors for PHS API generated

23 of the 24 entries now have vectors generated in my "testing" branch
of the PHC entries.  I had to do a ton of debugging with gdb.  Even my
own TwoCats entry had a problem which I had to track down.

The good news is I can now begin automated benchmarking of some sort.
The bad news is I need a vacation!
