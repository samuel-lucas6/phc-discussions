Well after all it looks like a simple misunderstanding. Catena isn't
supposed to be run with t_cost=lambda=0. In this case only
2*(garlic-min_garlic) calls to blake2b are made. This explains why
there is no difference between BRG and DBG and why your patched Catena
needs more memory.
Not catching this kind of mistake is clearly our fault and we already
uploaded a version with checks to our github repository.

Hi,

well, it seems that this kind of test is quite good in revealing such problems:)

So the minimum is mcost = tcost = 1 ?

I would like to run second run with fixes (does it make sense?)

The question is if the submitted PHC Catena version shouldn't be updated as well...

I would like just to track what exactly is run (released version) and
not just some random devel git tree state.

Thanks,
Milan
