The Pufferfish mistake in PHS() implementation (which includes even
buffer overflow) just
underlines that these trivial tests could be useful to find serious
problems.


Just for clarification, there is no requirement for PHS() to return raw
output, and you created the bug & subsequent buffer overflow in PHS()
with a half-baked patch.

Furthermore, PHS() is merely the wrapper for the sake of this contest.
The 'official' interface for the reference implemenation is pufferfish().
