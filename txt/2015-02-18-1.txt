I apologize, my comment was out-of-line.

KrisztiÃ¡n, perhaps I can give some more constructive feedback. I think you
are frustrated with a lack of transparency in the PHC process, and I agree
that's a problem. There is much internal discussion about the process being
more transparent.

As I have read your remarks though, I feel they're more motivated by your
emotions than by objective criticisms of the PHC. Perhaps you too can work
towards more constructive criticisms of the PHC?
