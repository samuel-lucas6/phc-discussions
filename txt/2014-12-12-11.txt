I'm not sure if we can take the Adobe leak as a good example, but in that  
case their single-key ECB mode had a similar effect as an unsalted keyed  
hash, in that we can see duplicates, but can't run a dictionary attack.  
Apparently 1,911,938 out of 130m were '123456', and the Top 100 passwords  
were used by almost 6,000,000 accounts. [1]

Salting at least makes a big difference in the special case where you have  
a keyed hash with an un-leaked key.
