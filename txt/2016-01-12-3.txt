Subject: Re: [PHC] Re: Attack on Argon2i?

The authors basically propose to discard the blocks between their last use
and overwrite. This strategy allows to use less memory (by a small constant
factor), though I still have to check the exact factor value.

My main technical concern is in the analysis of the multi-pass Argon2i. The
authors compute the probability of each block to survive at _every_ step,
so that these probabilities accumulate over time whereas they should not. I
will double-check the details and report on them ASAP.

The attack appears to require a pre-computation phase to pre-compute the
time after which some blocks will not be needed any more, so they can be
discarded during the computational phase, thus saving memory.

So overall the computation appears is larger, and I'm not sure in which
