document, in addition to using funds raised from users to encourage
continual feature enhancements.  The talk is about getting users to
pay "lunch" once a year rather than securing passwords.

Therefore, I'm sending out a call for big geeks to join me in what
I'm calling for now GeekCrypt.  It will be a TrueCrypt fork run by
crypto geeks, and secured by geeks:

Hi Bill,

just for your information, there is another independent and GPL
implementation of TrueCrypt format, inside cryptsetup code (Zulucrypt
uses it for opening volume while using tc-play for creating the TC volume).

Cryptsetup supports even old TC containers (in CBC and LRW mode
and all possible combinations, except some limitation caused by
Linux kernel), tc-play can open only XTS containers (but it
can also create them).
The underlying dm-crypt is the same.

(The inability to create containers in cryptsetup is intentional, adding
support for it is quite easy but primary format is LUKS. I do not
want to split resources, so focusing to own native LUKS format).
For more info see https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/

And to not to be completely of topic, my plan for next generation
of LUKS is to use new KDF from PHC finalist, I have already some
favorite candidates :-)

And yes, the cryptsetup is just for Linux (for now).

Sorry for off-topic,
Milan

p.s.
TrueCrypt fork is nice but I am afraid of license problems,
including possible inheritance code from E4M project etc.
