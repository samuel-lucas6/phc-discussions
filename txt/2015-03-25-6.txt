Minimum parameters is good, but probably it is also necessary to consider the number of calls to the underlying function as previously suggested by Steve Thomas.

I agree.  Actually, consider the total number of rounds of the
underlying primitive.

we are currently working with GPU-based implementations of candidates. If we finish the tests in time, we will try to submit it to the PasswordsCon . 

Cool!  Let me know if access to our dev box with GTX TITAN and HD 7990
would be of any help.

Also, it'd be nice to have your implementations integrated into JtR.
