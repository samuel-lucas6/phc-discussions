I suggested it back in mid 2012 but had "hash('sha256', $pw)" for PHP's crypt().
It was part of an encrypted bcrypt hash library I made. Luckily I went with hex
output. Probably because I knew about the problems with byte values >127 in some
versions of bcrypt. Also I apparently never updated it... I'll do it tomorrow.

P.S. PHP's crypt() also breaks with NUL characters.
