2. `hash.call(salt, chains.join)` isn't parallelizable but takes a
significant amount of time (A third with SHA-256).

This implementation is clearly naive. In C you could preallocate a large
buffer where the string could be constructed in place in parallel, and the
hash function could be run incrementally as more chunks become available
(assuming you run M threads at a time to compute N chains). I could modify
the Ruby version to do this as well.

The problem is that you first join the chains, and then hash them. So the
hashing is completely sequential. You need to first hash each chain, than
concatenate the hashes and then hash again.

I can't say I understand what you're getting at here. Do you have
something I can read on this topic? (possibly the scrypt paper?

I don't know any sources for this technique, but I suspect it can be used
on all hashing schemes with predictable memory access.

* You can use it to accelerate scrypt's first phase, but not the second
phase. Since scrypt only claims that the second phase is memory-hard, this
doesn't break scrypt.
   Discussed this with solardiz on twitter:

* You can use it on yarrkov's high AT proof-of-work scheme:

The general idea is that you don't keep everything in memory you're
supposed to, but only an occasional checkpoint. From this checkpoint you
can recompute memory near it. Often it's a good choice to keep sqrt(n)
checkpoints from which you can recompute any value you're interested in in
time n/sqrt(n)=sqrt(n).

On specialized hardware it's often cheap to recompute it in parallel to
your normal computation without delaying the normal computation.
Unpredictable memory access often breaks this, since the recomputation
delays the normal computation instead of running in parallel.

It's often possible to improve upon the sqrt(n) technique by adding more
intermediate steps. But I didn't work out the details.
