Just don't say this to IBM ;-)

There's a lot of PPC used in embedded devices like automotive control and
related stuff, but that's unlikely to be processing passwords.  Something like
MIPS would be more relevant than PPC due to its use in SOHO routers and
similar gear.

I am using server hw (actually I cannot use the most recent one - it is for development
and benchmarks are not allowed) but definitely this hw is intended for business
applications (and definitely it is not dead despite x86 is mainstream).

But the main reason for trying PPC was big-endian arch, not the performance.

For ARM, I would prefer to target to ARM64 architecture but this is still very new and even
if I probably have access to some hw, I cannot use it for benchmarks yet.
