Lots of sackcloth and ashes as EBay loses a password file.

It occurs to me that most of the time, machines do password files
wrong. Rather than using a salted hash, a better approach would be to
use a MAC with a randomly chosen key that is never disclosed.

Now this seems obvious but I can't recall ever seeing code set up to
do the job this way...

The proper way to hash passwords is at https://password-hashing.net/

(or someone was late to submit her proposal !)
