Hi,

Yes, but Gmane is not completely down.  Someone has just posted a
message to oss-security via Gmane, I think using its NNTP gateway.

The web archive is down, yes.

This was where this mailing-list was archived, and the PHC website
indicates as much. So we are in need of a new hosting somewhere for the
mailing-list archives. Any idea or suggestion?

(It seems www.archive.org did not scoop up the emails.)

The PHC Web site is hosted somewhere, so putting a copy of the archive
on the same machine might be relevant. Alternatively, I have a server
that sits idle most of the time, so I could contribute some hosting
space if needed.

I can easily add the PHC list archive to http://lists.openwall.net - I
just need a copy of the full archive so far.  Presumably, I can request
that from ezmlm, unless it's been told not to archive or not to honor
such requests.  Normally, ezmlm is willing to send list members copies
of archived messages, of up to 100 messages per request.
