Alexander, this is totally off topic...

It's on topic for this list, but off topic for this thread.  You could
have asked the same question in a correct thread, such as the one you
had started for SkinnyCat. ;-)

but did you see my submission
yesterday?  I am worried gmail sometimes drops emails with attachments
without any warning that I see.

Yes, I saw there was "TwoCats submission, which contains the SkinnyCat
sub-project as well", but I did not look at it.  I expect that someone
else on the PHC panel (perhaps JP) will respond to you about it.
