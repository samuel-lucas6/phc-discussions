May I assume that if the pswd is hashed client side, two conditions need

Yes

I'd say "secure tunnel" is orthogonal to "client-side hashing", as well
as to "better password hashing" in general.  Any of these are somewhat
nice to have even without the others, although of course a combination
of them is usually preferable.
