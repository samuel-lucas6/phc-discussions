Subject: Re: [PHC] Competition process

Earlier in January the panel agreed that Argon2 was too major a change
to be accepted as a "tweak". Actually the designers presented Argon2
as a separate algorithm rather than just a tweak of Argon1. It was
deemed that Lyra2's tweak was acceptable, OTOH.

I'm not saying that it's "fair" or that it's the best way to go,
whatever the criteria; I'm just reporting facts.

Personally I like Argon2 a lot, in part for its relative simplicity,
and wouldn't object to considering it as eligible if a critical mass
of panel members also approves. (Then I expect some other submitters
to complain that it isn't "fair".)

Let's see what other panel members have to say.

That's the approach I prefer (see my earlier thoughts about allowing a final
round of updates for the top three, before a single best-of-breed is chosen).
Argon2 is such an obvious improvement, it seems odd to keep it out so that the
decision has to be made on a previous-generation version.  Or, more
worryingly, that the decision on Argon might be made on the assumption that
what'll be adopted is actually Argon2, blurring the line over what's being
decided on.
