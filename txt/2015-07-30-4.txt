Hi, JP. 

We have no changes planned for Lyra2, unless there is some specific request. 

We are currently working on a hardware implementation of BlaMka, so it may change if we perceive some clear software-oriented optimization. However, since the underlying sponge is independent from Lyra2's design, I believe that does not qualify as a "change to Lyra2" :-) 

BR, 

Marcos.

Assunto: [PHC] Finalizing Catena, Lyra2, Makwa, yescrypt

Catena, Lyra2, Makwa, yescrypt are PHC's special recognitions. We'll
deliver packages (specs+code) of their final versions in Q3.
Meanwhile, minor changes can be made to the algorithms, but we need
to agree on those.

@Submitters of C, L, M, y: Do you intend to make any changes to your
algorithms? If so, which ones?

@Others/panel: What changes would you like to see in the finalists?
Why?

Thanks!
