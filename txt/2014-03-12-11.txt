I hope you meant the other guys, because at least for this kind of
thing, my help is worth less than you paid for it!

pwcrypt is sooo promising, yet the punny little utility that has that
name seems to have legitimate value to some people.  When I googled
WaywardGeek a few years ago, there was some guy on some dumb site like
DIY sod.  I would thank him now for holding the name for me.

I knew of JtR before I knew you were it's author.  That's an amazing
brand.  It freaked me out when I learned you wrote it.  Is there a way
to use that brand?  It will sound goofy, but something like JtRCrypt?

Bill
