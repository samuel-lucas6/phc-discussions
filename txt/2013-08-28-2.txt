I would avoid it. At least on its own it seems like a pretty trivial thing for which to drag in a whole C99 dependency.

But that's my personal bias from my (MSVC-heavy) experience.

I would agree that <stdbool.hshould be avoid and I don't have an MSVC 
bias ;-)

In Solaris code I often tend to use boolean_t (in code that is compiled 
with Solaris Studio, GCC and Clang) but this context I don't see any of 
the common/{de-facto}standard boolean types adding much value.
