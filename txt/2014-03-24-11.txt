Is Jeremi suggesting that the SHA512 step be left out of the expand
step? 

That was beloumi who suggested this, not me. But he was suggesting that
the output of the pufferfish encryption loop could be used directly,
instead of being hashed as sha512 before being written to the output
buffer. I have addressed this in my previous replies.
