You are totally right. I don't know how I missed this. The most
embarrassing thing is, that this would already be possible with
Catena. The only thing missing is the server-side finalization with
encryption.
I hope I haven't caused any confusion with my previous mail.

In this case, can everything but the last step be done client-side?
Ideally, the salt is a secret known only to the server and client, where
the client preferably stores it in a security key of some sort.

I feel like we should prototype a framework to support something like this.
