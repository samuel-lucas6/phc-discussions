Hey Bill,
 
    I'm another newbie - pleased to meet you - and haven't been reading many
posts since subscribing just a couple weeks ago.  Thank you for commenting
about a "clear_in_asap" flag.  That's something that I hadn't considered,
although the way my algorithm works, it probably won't buy me very much
since most of the execution time will have elapsed before it can be cleared.
 
    While I'm writing . I don't know the first thing about using parallel
threads.  Further, my API includes an optional flag which explicitly
requires that the calculation be done single-threaded.  Still, I'd be
curious how you do "that" and to know whether it's "portable".  Can you
provide a link and or source code fragment?
 
Thanks,
Gary
 
P.S.  In addition to being a crypto newbie, I'm also a newcomer to PHC,
having only learned of it a few months back, and having only installed a
suitable IDE (MS Visual Studio Express) in the past three weeks.

Nice.  Here are parameter's I've added to NoelKDF:
 
num_threads     - the number of threads to run in parallel
parallelism     - number of inner loops allowed to run in parallel - should
match
                  user's machine for best protection
num_hash_rounds - number of SHA256 rounds to compute the intermediate key
clear_in        - when true, overwrite the in buffer with 0's early on
 
Also, I "borrowed" the excellent Catena idea for "garlic", and use t_cost in
the outer loop, where I double memory each time through the loop.  Users
wont need it, but server admins will like it.  I also have a flag like yours
for clearing and freeing memory.
 
I have to say that people on this forum have been extremely generous with
their ideas and feedback.  As a crypto noob, I've benefitted tremendously.
 
Now... as for your chart.  That looks like your telling me the password
length based on the runtime of the hash.  Is this right?  A snooper for
run-time is trivial and runs in user mode.
 
Bill
