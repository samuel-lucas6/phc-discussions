Is it fair to say that the most interesting aspect of your entry is
the delegation capability?  I find that fascinating.  IIRC, there's no
arbitrary hash function called during delegation.  Is it possible to
add a memory-hard hash function call to the delegated password
hashing?  Maybe it's already there... after reading 23 papers, my head
is mush.

Another thing I get confused about is the entries that have server
specific short-cuts in computing the hashes.  Yours seems quite
ingenious to me in that respect, and I know the PHC site called for
such innovations specifically.  However, I get confused as to why this
is better than just having a server master password used to decrypt
password/user specific secret secondary keys?
