If you are optimizing the attack by iterating through each salt and
then going on to incrementally less popular passwords, (makes perfect
sense) then I would imagine if the defender naively does H(pwd||salt)
you could gain a significant optimization from that. Do you ever see
this in practice?


Yes, and this is immediately observable.
