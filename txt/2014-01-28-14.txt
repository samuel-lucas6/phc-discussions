Christian,

I guess the 128 constant in the snippet below was meant to be H_LEN,
since otherwise behavior will differ for H_LEN != 64, and it could even
be over-read beyond the malloc()'ed memory.

It should be 2*H_LEN since we want to compute

p[i] <-- Hash( p[i-1] || p[i]).

Thanks for this informal "bug" report. :-)

Best regards,
Christian
