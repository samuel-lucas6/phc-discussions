They shouldn't have had that safety margin, or the scheme would

actually criticized Lyra and Lyra2 papers for recommending T higher
than 1, which I feel would make these use less memory than they
optimally would.

This is a good point.  I only test Lyra2 with T of 1 because higher
values seem less secure to me.

It is probably better to ask authors to provide recommended parameters
for specific situations, such as authentication server settings, or
volume encryption settings, given specs of the machines and runtime goals.

I want to start benchmarking the candidates for volume encryption use.
 In this case, I could provide specific machine specs and a 1 second
runtime target.  That makes it a lot easier for authors to choose
parameters.
