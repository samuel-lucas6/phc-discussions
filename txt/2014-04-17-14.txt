 I see it vary randomly all over the place, while the total runtime remains
fairly constant.  That's why I don't try to factor out the memory
allocation overhead.

Yes, the user vs. system time doesn't reliably correspond to hashing vs.
memory allocation overhead.  Not on my systems, too.  To determine the
overhead-less speeds, we need to measure time within the program or/and
iterate the hash computation many times while keeping the allocation.
