I've just forked the code, and I'll look into adding a PHS_thread or some
such thing.  Actually, it looks like the original Argon was enhanced to add
multi-threading, so technically there are four: Argon, Argon2 (i and d),
Lyra2, and Yescrypt.

I see that the Argon entry already provides a PHSx function that adds one
parameter: m_thread.  I'll modify Lyra2 and Yescrypt in my repo to also
provide a PHSx.  I do feel bad for picking on the Argon team when their
code is improving so rapidly.  The code is what really counts.
