Oh, we don't need a "large verifier" to tell us that.  If we have a symmetric
winner then any site with any significant number of users will say "we won't
use that because we can't manage our verification costs the way we need to".
This is why I asked for an asymmetric option for the CFP, alongside the O( n )
everywhere for smaller sites we also need an O( 1 ) on the server, O( n ) on
the client for larger users, so some sort of trapdoor-function iterated-
hashing mechanism perhaps.
