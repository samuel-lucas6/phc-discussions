Actually, the % operation would dominate, but I hash a page at a time... so assume it costs 0.1 clocks.

Since Rand(i) % i doesn't depend on anything specific to the candidate password, couldn't it be precomputed? Or computed and fed to a large number of processors performing the rest of the loop in parallel.

It looks like all memory accesses are predictable, therefore a custom external memory subsystem could be constructed which accepts streaming data as fast as you can you can move it on and off the chip (IO pin count * clock rate * DDR perhaps). But presumably the defender would not be able to utilize such an architecture, so it would represent an advantage to the attacker.
