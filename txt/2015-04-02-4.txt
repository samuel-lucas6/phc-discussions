I agree with you that the schemes with several parameters need to list the
parameters being used.

Makes sense.  Right now, they're hard-coded in PHS(), but are generally
not explicitly listed elsewhere.

Further, I think that it is better for the designers to fix those
parameters in the competition.

This is (mostly) how it is now, due to PHS().

Otherwise, the parameters can be tuned to
favor one type of comparison, then get tuned to favor another different
type of comparison.

This may be a good thing, although it does have a drawback: potential
confusion about what we're comparing.

In actual usage, those extra parameters may in fact be tuned to match
specific use cases better.  We just need to ensure that both schemes
being compared are tuned for the same use case.

And indeed, it should be viewed as an advantage of a scheme if it
achieves competitive results even without tuning for the use case.
