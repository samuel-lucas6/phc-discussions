Maybe I should just tell everyone to use icc, which doesn't seem to have
these problems (and generally produces better code than gcc to boot).

I'm pretty sure any aggressive enough compiler will do these. Cf. http://goo.gl/tYzkvD

Curiously, for all compilers currently available on gcc.godbolt.org
except for icc, adding -fwrapv results in code getting generated for the
assert().  (But we should not use this as an excuse for writing broken
checks like this.)  icc appears to silently ignore -fwrapv (for gcc
"compatibility" maybe).
