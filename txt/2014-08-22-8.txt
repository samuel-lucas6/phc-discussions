Suppose you'd optimally attack Catena-3 at 1/32 memory, and Lyra2 and
Argon at full memory.  However, if Catena-3 at same defensive memory
cost setting is e.g. twice faster than Lyra2 and Argon (an arbitrary
number for the sake of illustrating my point), then this may enable a
defender to use roughly twice more memory with Catena-3 to achieve the
same (maximum affordable) time cost per hash computed.  Once Catena-3 is
tuned like that, its non-tradeoff area-time cost probably grows by a
factor of 4, meaning that it loses to Lyra2 and Argon only by a factor
of 8, not 32 as this could have originally appeared.

I was wrong in "only by a factor of 8, not 32".  For a moment I confused
1/32 being the optimal tradeoff point as the attack being 32 times
cheaper, but it's not as bad as that.

The paper made several good points, but I have trouble with this part of
their analysis.  They assumed that the power per password guess burned in
memory is proportional to the total amount of memory used, rather than the
number of memory reads and writes.  This is simply not the case.  With the
computation penalty increasing memory accesses, I suspect memory power
would go up, not down, in any TMTO attack against Catena.

I do not believe Catena-3 has a TMTO problem against ASIC attacks.
However, with an ASIC computing 100 Blake2 hashes in parallel pipes at
3GHz, not in any way limited by memory latency when reading from 24MiB of
cache... there is a problem.  The Microsoft presenter stated that 3 orders
of magnitude difference in speed for one password guess between a CPU and
an ASIC would be unrealistic.  He was simply wrong.
