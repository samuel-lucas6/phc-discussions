Subject: Suggestion: API should include a verifier function

I think to be a "complete" solution, the API should include a verify
function which guarantees a constant time comparison, similar to what NaCl
provides for its authenticators:

http://nacl.cr.yp.to/auth.html

e.g.

    crypto_auth(a,m,mlen,k);
    crypto_auth_verify(a,m,mlen,k);

Without such an API, I am afraid that users of the API will screw up the
comparison and open themselves up to a timing attack.

The arguments of the verifier function are identical to the original
hashing function, except instead of calculating a password hash, you'd
provide a user-supplied one as input, and verify via a guaranteed constant
time comparison whether or not it's correct.
