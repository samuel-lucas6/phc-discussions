I've received an update of the POMELO code, will be up soon.

While I don't have the time myself to do it this weekend, it might be better
actually looking at the PHS output and what's going on in the reference
implementation because you'd expect at least a wee bit of non-zero results.
What you've got looks like a bug somewhere.

Also, although it's probably not what's causing your results here, I'm
fairly sure that the dieharder tests aren't great for short inputs.

If you want to demonstrate an algorithm isn't collision resistant, a sample
collision usually persuades people, e.g. x = f(a_1) = f(a_2).  Or at least
provide an argument of how much work would be required to generate a
collision.
