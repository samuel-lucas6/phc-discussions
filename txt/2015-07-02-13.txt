We don't have formal proof for ECC, DH, or RSA, either.

He uses ARX (add, rotate, xor) instructions randomly generated by a

Agreed.  However, it looks like he got the algorithm almost-right, just
based on intuition.

I wish that were true!  The number of entries that did not consider speed
important in a memory-hard hash function were surprisingly high!  Basic
memory*time defense typically goes as the square of memory-filling speed.

I think he would also have enjoyed helping create those archives... The
timing of his entry is simply wrong.
