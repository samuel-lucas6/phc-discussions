Subject: Re: [PHC] PolyPassHash is broken

There are a lot of ways you can configure PPH.

It's possible that you can have the normal user accounts log in right away
(using partial verification), but block administrator logins until a
threshold have provided passwords.  Alternatively, you can let admins with
TFA / special questions log in, but not those with only the partial
verification match.

You can mix and match depending on what makes sense for your specific
server / deployment scenario.

This has been a useful discussion.  We have a few more configuration
options to add...

Unattended boot is pretty essential for any mission critical system, so
probably not.

There are other ways to solve this problem though, like a hardware device
