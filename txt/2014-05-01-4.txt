Historically, salts haven't been considered secret, but there's this
precomputation attack and there are timing attacks on comparison of
hashes (of course, it can also be dealt with by using a constant-time
comparison function, if one is available or can be implemented).  Now
side-channel attacks on hash functions themselves are added to these two
attack categories, for a total of three (or are there more?)

I think it's fair game to assume or stipulate that salts, while not
secret for purposes of possible offline attacks, are stored along with
the hashes and are not revealed separately, except if mandated by the
protocol (such as for server relief), in which case some security
tradeoffs are accepted (and need to be understood and possibly mitigated
by other means).

I think it is my cue to point out that with Makwa, the delegation allows
to offload the bulk of the computation to an untrusted system (who can
be the client itself) without revealing anything, in particular without
giving away the salt. And, more generally, since the system to which
computation is delegated does not receive anything secret, it cannot
leak any secret either.

There can be side-channel leaks on the source system -- the server --
but since that system does not have to do the heavy computational work,
suboptimal but leak-safe implementation techniques can be used. In a
basic Makwa implementation, the password _length_ may leak, but not the
password contents, and that's for a one-shot initial operation which is
done within microseconds, so the attack window is not wide.
