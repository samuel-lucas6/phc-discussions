How realistic is this in terms of real-world use though?  ARM announce all
sorts of cool things as tech previews that then take years to appear in real-
world products (the "No Product announcement from ARM for ARMv8-A at this
time" in the presentation is pretty telling).  And I don't mean "we ship
silicon in Q4, 2014", but is it present in phones right now?  Also, are the
instructions user-accessible?  Another annoying thing about ARM SoC's is that
a lot of the capabilities, e.g. hardware RNGs, are only accessible from kernel
mode or, more generally, not from standard user mode.
