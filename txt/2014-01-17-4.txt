Hi Bill,

Thank you for your reply.

Do you suggest that aside from the theoretical side channel attack, and
under the assumption that the recomputation of the missing data is
computationally expensive, an attacker cannot achieve more than 2x speedup?

Regards,
Ivica

I have a question about a possible PHC design strategy:
Assume the defender is sitting on a GPU and his/her KDF saturates the
memory
bandwidth. The look-up table used in the KDF is large and it does not
depend
on the password. How can an attacker achieve a speed up?

Can I assume that the KDF does random lookups in memory based on the
password?  The first problem, which isn't major IMO, is the attacker
can fill memory once, and then make password guesses without spending
the time or bandwidth to do it again.  Assuming each password guess
the same time and bandwidth as filling memory in the first place, an
attacker only gains a 2X advantage.  That's very good, really
outstanding, IMO.  On the GPU, you might even be able to make enough
use of all the cores to begin increasing an attacker's cost
significantly.  On our CPUs, even 32 parallel multipliers is cheap
compared to the cost of even 1GB of external RAM.  4096 multipliers in
parallel begins to be interesting.

Silicon in most processes costs around $0.05/mm^2.  Assume an attacker
is paying $0.10/mm^2 for 22nm, and package/test takes it to $0.20/mm^2
(a total WAG).  A carry-save adder is maybe 12 gates of logic, and we
need around 16x32 of them, for around 6100 gates.  Assuming and-packed
logic in 22nm does about 1,000,000 gates/mm^2, we can probably pack
150 of them per mm^2.  4096 of them would cost around $5.50.  That's
comparable to the memory cost.

Assuming the defender has a high-end graphics card, he can get better
protection using it.  Someone else will have to comment on whether
cache timing attacks are even possible against a graphics card, but if
they are, an attacker might be able to gain advantage by aborting
incorrect password guesses early based on memory access pattern.  One
thing to worry about is time-memory trade-offs.  If an ASIC attacker
can reduce the external RAM 4X or more, and recompute the missing data
in parallel with a few cores, he gains a major advantage.
