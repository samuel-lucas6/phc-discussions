I also think we should pass a boolean telling Argon2 if it's OK to
scrub the password buffer passed in once the initial derived key is
computed.  We talk a lot about garbage-collection attack resistance, and
then we just leave the password sitting there in it's buffer.  This is
pretty sad, IMO.

I propose passing two pointers instead, one "const char *" and the other
non-const.  If the non-const pointer is not NULL, then this one will be
used for scrubbing.

Rationale: some reasonable higher-level APIs may already have the const
(or will have), so we'd have to cast it away for the scrubbing if we
used the Boolean parameter approach.

I welcome other thoughts on this, though.  My preference might change.

Also, have Alexander's concerns about excessive parallelism in Argon2 been
addressed?  I missed the resolution of this issue.

Not yet.

Would his suggested MAXFORM (whatever that is) fix it?

Yes, and it'd achieve more than that.
