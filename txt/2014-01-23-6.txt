Your are welcome to fork Catena. I add you as a Collaborator. So feel
free to add an optimized version of Catena.

Thanks!  I'll make a waywardgeek branch where I can thrash the code
without impacting master.  There are several things I want to try,
including the faster hash function, and larger block sizes.  I also
want to see what can be done for useful parallelism.  It may make
sense to run Catena-3 on GPUs in the future on purpose, for example,
and we'll never reach the kinds of memory bandwidth Alexander obtains
without more parallelism.
