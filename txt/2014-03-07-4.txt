Bill,

Another correction:

BTW, why do you mention 32 KiB there?  Your random lookups arena is
only 16 KiB, and you can't make it larger than that on current CPUs with
32 KiB L1d cache and 2 hardware threads/core, without incurring much
extra L1 cache thrashing.  TigerKDF's total memory usage is irrelevant.

Of course, my "TigerKDF's total memory usage is irrelevant" implies "as
long as the total memory usage is low enough that a sufficiently high
number of concurrent instances fit in global memory", which is the case
we should be considering in this context.  32 KiB is low enough (it's
twice lower than Litecoin's 128/2 = 64 KiB, considering that Litecoin is
commonly mined with 2x TMTO).  In that case, the small random lookups
arena's size is relevant, whereas the total memory usage is not (yet).
