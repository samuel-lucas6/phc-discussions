These look correct to me, given the Lyra2 algorithm on page 11 in
Lyra2ReferenceGuide.pdf for T=1.

That was in v0.  It is page 12 in v1.

BTW, Lyra2ReferenceGuide.pdf's cover page says "Version 2.3" and "March
30, 2013" in both v0 and v1 - looks like this version number was not
updated, and the date is off by more than a year. ;-)  Page 2 corrects
this by listing higher version numbers and their corresponding dates.
