can someone explain me how this does not leak information through 
total running time? (that is, not cache timing, but traffic
analysis.)


For proof of work, I don't think they care about leaking meta data.
They seem more interested in being able to easily prove that they did
all the work they claim.

I would need to look more carefully, but at first glance I like it for
proof of work, but would pass on trying to use it for password hashing.
