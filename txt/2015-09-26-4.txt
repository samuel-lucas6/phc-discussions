So for (ye)scrypt we could have:

$7X$Nrhp$salt$hash

where "N" is encoding of N-1,

I meant: where "N" is encoding of log2(N)-1.

"r" is encoding of r-1, "h" is encoding of
have-1, and "p", "f", "t", or/and "g" are encodings of p-2, flags-1,
t-1, g-1 if those are non-default and indicated as present in "have".

The "-1" for log2(N) and r is primarily to make the too small invalid
values non-encodable.  For the rest (the optional parameters), the "-2"
and "-1" are primarily to ensure deterministic encoding.
