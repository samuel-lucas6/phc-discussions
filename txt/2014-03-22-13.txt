I use Christian's solution for this.  It loses up to 2X in terms of
time*memory security, so users would not use this up-front.

Actually, up to 3x - that is, Catena's area-time cost to attacker
converges to 1/3 of what's optimal, after many upgrades.  With
(acceptably) higher granularity of upgrades, we can improve this to 3/5
of optimal.  (I posted these numbers in here a few months ago.)

Gary has a similar idea, but he wants to store the new rehashing
parameters in a chain with each password.  That would allow the admin
to take that 50MiB hash and turn it into a 2-step hash of 50 MiB and
400MiB.  It's more efficient, but adds complexity.

I've been thinking of this too, even considered how the info would be
encoded - but I think I'll simply go for the 3/5 option.
