Subject: Argon optimized implementation

Hi all,

we have developed an optimized implementation of Argon for the CPUs
equipped with AES-NI instructions:
https://github.com/khovratovich/Argon/tree/master/Argon-Optimized

There are both Linux and Windows versions, which are for the moment
identical, thanks to portable intrinsics.

Running it with parameter "-benchmark" gives performance benchmarks for 2^d
MBytes of memory and different number of threads (from 1 to 16).

On our own machines (Ivy and Sandy Bridge) the optimized Argon runs as
follows:
64 MB: 8 cpb with 4 threads, 16 cpb with 1 thread
1 GB:  9 cpb with 4 threads, 20 cpb with 1 thread

We would appreciate anyone benchmarking Argon on other hardware.

Comments are welcome!
