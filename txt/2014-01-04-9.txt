I think what helped the optimizer is your addition of lots of
parallelism (way too much for current CPUs, in fact).  The sequential
nature of reads allows PAGE_LENGTH to be beyond L1 data cache size.

I think it'd be better to have random reads, keep PAGE_LENGTH*3*2 within
L1 data cache size, and have just enough parallelism for current and
near-future CPUs (preferably, have it tunable).  Also, make it SIMD
friendly (tricky with random reads - would need to make them the size of
a SIMD vector, so that you don't require gather loads).
