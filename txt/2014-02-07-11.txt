reading patents to see what they cover is a good idea. It is not. If you
infringe on a patent without having known that you did so, you may end up
paying damages to the patent holder. But if they can prove that you
willfully infringed (because you knew about their patent), you may end up
paying triple damages. So if you read a patent, you automatically increase
your liability for infringing that patent by a factor of three.

"And now for the real stinger: even if you read a patent and decide, as an
expert in your field, that your work is not covered by the patent, the
judge might still find that you willfully infringed. You see, you as an
expert are not qualified to judge what a patent covers. Only a patent
lawyer can do that. So if you want to avoid the possibility of having to
pay triple damages, you have to pay a patent lawyer to figure out whether
you are infringing the patent or not. There are millions of patents out
there, and you cannot possibly afford to pay a patent lawyer to read every
one of them.

​I'd tend to agree - especially since it's only been US patents discussed
so far, I'm sure the EU/Asia will massively compound the problem - but
nevertheless, it would be good to have some clear guidance from ​the
organisers of the PHC on this issue, as merely stating that submissions
shouldn't infringe on existing patents, and whether those patents don't
have prior art, is somewhat infeasible to check.
