Sorry for resurrecting an earlier incarnation of this thread but wanted to
pose the question: are we actually worried about people using ASICs for
password cracking?

It depends.  For military strength security, I have to say yes, and
I'm hoping the PHC winner cares about that case.  I'd say it is very
likely that China has an ASIC based password cracking center.  For
most people, likely even including large companies like Apple and
Target, probably not.

Have ASICs been used for password cracking to date?

Yes.  I notice no one replies to threads where I get specific about
that, so I'm going to stop doing that.

If the NSA, GCHQ, et al. are targeting someone, do they not already have
numerous measures to compromise hosts other than password cracking?

After reading so many Snowden revelations, I guess it's pretty clear they do.

I hope they aren't wasting my tax dollars, but if the NSA has
legitimate needs for cracking passwords that other's can't, then they
would be doing a very poor job without an ASIC based cracking center.

Another reason to focus on ASICs is that you defend against all
architectures when you defend against ASICs.  Commercial chips with
many CPU cores (say 1024 like my example) capable of hashing Bcrypt as
fast per core as my Intel Core i7 may be in our near future.  With
that event, Bcrypt security will drop tremendously.  Scrypt will fare
far better.

Given a chance to develop a new PHS, I would hope solutions will be
found that defend against ASICs, GPUs, and FPGAs to varying extents,
without giving up on any of them.
