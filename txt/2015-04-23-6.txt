I updated PHC candidates test with latest run

 https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/phc_round2.pdf

- many code updates announced here (including Argon, Catena, MAKWA, etc)
- added parallel test

This includes PPC now.  I think it should go up to a much higher number
of threads on the PPC machine - whatever it supports in hardware (64?)

- I used newer machine for test (Lenovo x240 i7 CPU)

This is AVX2 capable, right?  But you're not building for AVX2 yet?

(And this reminds me that I should submit AVX2 code for yescrypt.)

- Added pwxround=2 yescrypt to normalized test

I think it'll be relevant to all other tests as well. ;-)  And even
PWXrounds=1 too. ;-)

- yescrypt now uses -opt version (not reference)
(I did not add it to other test these were meant to use defaults).

I don't understand.  What "other test" did you not add this to?

- All tested passwords are now randomly generated (/dev/urandom)
(previously were hardcoded in test program)

(Git history contains all changes.)

Thanks for all suggestion and thanks algorithms authors for fixing bugs!

Thank you for running these tests, Milan!
