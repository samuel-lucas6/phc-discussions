Actually, there is a point in any competition in which it is hard not to
think "if only these guys had worked together from the start, we
probably would have a much better solution combining their ideas". But
since humans seem to bring better ideas to the table when they are
competing instead of when they are at a "task force", competitions do
have their purpose...

One think I like a lot about Lyra2 is that you guys adopted good ideas when
you saw them.  I have confidence that if selected as a winner, you could
work with Alexander and others to further improve Lyra2 if allowed.
