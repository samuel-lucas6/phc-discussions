You can certainly do the n^2 ANDs and add things up, but that seems like a waste of gates. What is the cost metric being
considered here? Time (circuit depth)? Area? Time * Area?

Time (circuit depth).  We're using MULs for latency hardening, so our
worst case attacker would optimize for lower latency.

As a theoretical curiosity, Brent and Kung [1] came up with an optimal area-time n-bit multiplier of depth O(n^(1/2) log
n) and area O(n log n). Melhorn-Preparata's [2] circuit would be O(log n), O(n^2 / log n).

Thanks.

The above would be (asymptotically) depth O(log n) and area O(n^2).

Right.
