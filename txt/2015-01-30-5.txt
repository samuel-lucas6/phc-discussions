Substantial changes to a submission would complicate the work of the

candidate adds new features, drop some others, etc.

What is of course acceptable are editorial changes to the document,
new or improved implementations.

That's what I thought.

Curiously, this gives submitters incentive to add/drop features now,
before the tweaks deadline, even if some of the corresponding changes
are not yet polished, and to polish them later ("editorial changes",
"improved implementations") as long as compatibility is maintained.

Maybe that's how we want it.
