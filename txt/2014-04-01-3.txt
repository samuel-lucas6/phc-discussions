Subject: Doubts about AntCrypt floating-point use

I expect the floating point use to be very non-portable.

Consider  F07(33843633) which before casting to int evaluates to
72664774.99999999931. So the cast to int should truncate it to
72664774, but my implementation actually rounds it to 72664775.

Double only has a 53 bit mantissa, but your code expects it to have
more than 64 or to be completely reproducible across implementations
(it's not).
