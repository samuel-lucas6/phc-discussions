Well, my post still holds, on the fact that having an account with AM

Legally its not afaik.

The amount of passwords cracked by @CynoPrime however, and their current
estimates says they will crack 90-95% of all the passwords - for all
accounts, I have no doubt AM have completely FUBAR their password
storage implementation.

To clarify, if the unverified account had authenticated once bcrypt
was available they would have transitioned from MD5AM and MD5AM2?

Also bcrypt wasn't available in PHP until v5.5 according to
http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php and if correlating
their repository logs to PHP release timelines proves that they didn't
"reinvent the wheel" then an apology should be made on Graham's blog
don't you think Per? :)
