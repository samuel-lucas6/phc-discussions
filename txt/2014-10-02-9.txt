You convinced me.

Assuming random ROM (this is important, collisions are easy if ROM can be
partially chosen) and fixed salt length, you can show that the entire
construction is as secure as the duplex construction.

I will correct the table accordingly.

however in this case the mode of operation is the *same* as in the
underlying primitive. i don't use keccak. gambit *is* keccak. it
directly inherits security properties from the duplex construction.

in Gambit you did not encode both

though you use the sponge construction properly.

i defined the salt as fixed length. it is explained in the document,
as well as it is clear from the source code.
