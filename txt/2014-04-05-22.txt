Subject: Quick gripe... in case there's ever another contest

I'm having fun compiling all the various schemes, but I have had to
hand-modify most of them to get them to be compatible with my main.c.
It's no biggie, but a bit of a pain.  If you guys influence future
competitions, could you please include a main.c and possibly even an
example project that successfully builds using it?  Maybe we should
have required linux compatible makefiles, and that make PHS generate
an executable using the shared main.c file?

It'd save me quite a few hours of work, which is no biggie.  The scary
part is that I am personally hand editing files.  One of the entries
that I edited failed the dieharder tests because of my edits, so I'm
glad I didn't report that failure until I verified it!

Given how much lost confidence there likely will be in any
computational security claim I make about a hand edited entry, it sure
would have been nice to not require any hand editing.
