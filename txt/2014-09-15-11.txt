Meanwhile, there's standalone minerd:

https://github.com/noncepool/cpuminer-yescrypt
http://forum.globalboost.org/index.php?topic=197.0

which works fine for me (and the rebuilt new wallet happens to work,
too).  It does 11.03 kh/s on 2x E5-2670, and 3.47 kh/s on i7-4770K.
(I built it with "-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -march=native" on each.)

There are also several pools (3 of them so far?)  This one works for me,
along with minerd above:

BTW, this pool currently reports:

"Network Hashrate: 1,942.19 KH/s | Pool Hashrate: 955.08 KH/s | Workers: 179"

955.08/179 = ~5.33 kh/s per worker (maybe many machines are dual-CPU or bigger?)

1942.19/3.47 = ~560 equivalents of i7-4770K are currently mining BSTY

Maybe we'll see attempts at more optimized yescrypt code soon - e.g.,
AVX2 code is easy to write, likely for some speedup.  I've been
postponing this as it was not essential for PHC at this time (with other
aspects having higher priority), but perhaps folks who are serious about
mining this coin will feel differently.
