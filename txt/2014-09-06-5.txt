Hash: SHA1

I went ahead and did a basic RIG benchmark with the code submitted.
It hashes 1GiB on my test machine with t_cost = 4 (similar graph to
Catena-3) in 2.27s.  This is worse than Scrypt, but many times better
than any other cache-timing resistant algorithm.

The cache-timing password defense provided by TwoCats in terms of
memory*time cost is about 16X lower than Catena and RIG
architecturally for a few different reasons I explained in my
submission.  However, TwoCats on a a single thread and minimum
multiplication chains does a 1GiB hash in 0.22s.

I conclude that RIG (once fixed) likely provides about a 50% better
time*memory defense against a brute-force password guessing attack
with cache-timing data.  That makes it the strongest in the
competition in this category.  Second would be TwoCats :-)
