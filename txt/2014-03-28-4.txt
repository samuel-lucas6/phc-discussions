Right.

I had actually considered revising the original bcrypt to introduce that
"outer loop", and I felt that it could be done without it appearing as
an extra loop.  bcrypt already has its 2^cost loop - that one loop could
be revised to move the 4 KiB region across a larger arena and to XOR (or
whatever) it with random 4 KiB regions in the already-written portion of
the arena.

+1 for this solution.  That would make PufferFish competitive.
