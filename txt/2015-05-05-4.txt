Er.. NIST?  Do we really want them involved?

We might or might not care, but I think for some prospective users
having the PHC winner NIST-standardized would be a plus.  In fact, for
some it could be a requirement.  That's why we have SHA-crypt, and
that's why Drupal 7 switched to SHA-512 as the crypto primitive for
their revision of phpass.  In both cases, needing NIST-approved crypto
was explicitly cited as the primary reason for the change.

Do you think NIST's reputation is that bad now it'd reflect badly on the
PHC winner?  I think it's not that bad.  An algorithm coming from/via
NIST could be received badly, but one that was developed and selected by
PHC independently of NIST and is later merely standardized is fine.
