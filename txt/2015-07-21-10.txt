Argon2 will be the basis for the final PHC winner. What should be change to make it better than it is now?

If it isn’t too much trouble, it would be nice to have the LaTeX source up on github. That would allow people to submit pull requests with improvements to English language phrasing. (Though I note that the PDF version on github is much more recent then the one I read yesterday, so perhaps this is no longer needed.)

"- A hybrid Argon2i/Argon2d (Argon2id?), where some initial fraction of memory hashing is done in a cache-timing independent manner, followed by unpredictable addressing to improve off-line attack resistance.  If this fraction were a parameter, it would unify Argon2i and Argon2d into one algorithm.

I very much would like to see i and d brought together, even at the cost of an additional parameter.

I’m very much looking forward to a reference implementation. I had to add a few #includes, <stdlib.hand <x86intrin.h>, to get this to build on OS X and ran into some odd runtime problems.

Cheers,
