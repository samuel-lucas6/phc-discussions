BTW, the same paper says there's a 12X reduction in area-time cost against
TwoCats.  They're smoking something good, and I want some!

Looks like a ton of good effort by a lot of good people, but there's a
table claiming TwoCats generates only 1.26 bytes/cycle on a Haswell CPU
compared to some lame speed by their algorithm.  Huh?

I just measured it on a similar CPU at 0.46 cycles/byte   There are
trade-offs,, and speed isn't everything.  It just happens to be fun :)
 Sorry, but the authors here made a mistake.
