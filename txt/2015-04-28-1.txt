I see.  It does seem odd to ask the testing volunteer to create his own
interface to the candidates.

I think there are just 3 candidates now supporting multiple threads.  It is
surprisingly hard to guestimate parallel thread performance from parallel
process performance.  The reasons remain mysterious to me, but the short
version is that each thread seems to want sole access to it's own page.
Mixing nearby read/writes between threads thrashes something, maybe the
translation lookaside buffer?

I guess I'd like guidance from the PHC panel on this issue, if they want to
see multi-threaded performance.  It seems like an important attribute to
me, and there's no knob in the PHS interface.

I would be interested, personally and as a panel member, to see those 3
candidates' (is that Argon2, Lyra2, yescrypt?) multi-threaded
performance included in Milan's reports.  Bill, maybe you can contribute
to Milan's code?  I think it's all on GitHub, so perhaps you can make a
pull request.

BTW, Argon2 is still not formally accepted.  Yet I'd like to see more of
its benchmarks.
