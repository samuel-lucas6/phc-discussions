See <https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881>.

this article says nothing about the importance of side channel
attacks. it just mentions which algorithms are safe against it and
which are not. the question here is the relevance of such attacks. and
the time you bring it up is not appropriate considering that almost
all of the second round candidates are unsafe in this regard, while
many safe algorithms were eliminated. i stand by my statement.
