On Wed, Jan 15, 2014 at 12:38 PM, Peter Maxwell Well, using floats
in cryptography is not exactly a new idea but I suspect
it does have some portability problems, e.g. there's implementation of
Bernstein's poly1305 using floating point - http://cr.yp.to/mac/53.html -
although I haven't actually sat down to look at it... it's sitting fairly
far down on my to-do list.

There are also compiler specific issues.  I've had considerable
trouble over the years forcing various compilers to not optimize my
floating point in any way to insure that I get the same answer on all
machines.

I like the idea of floating point, but I doubt it's worth the excess
trouble we'll run into.  32x32 -32 Integer multiply seems solid and
pervasive enough.  Besides that, it's fast in our devices even
compared to a custom ASIC, and it's a great operation for mixing bits,
at least when one op is odd.
