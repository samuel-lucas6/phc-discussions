Hi all,

thanks to the authors for the benchmarking paper. Nevertheless, we 
do not agree with the results for Catena since the authors in the 
paper did not consider the current version of Catena (Catena v3.1) 
which can be found here:

http://www.uni-weimar.de/fileadmin/user/fak/medien/professuren/Mediensicherheit/Research/Publications/catena-v3.1.pdf

They refer to the version from December 2014 which does not contain
the latest tweaks such as: - reduced-round version of blake - 
additional random layer - changed initialization phase - removed 
SHA-512 from the parameter recommendations for the underlying hash 
function - ...

They also ignored the instance Catena-DBG, which was already 
mentioned in the ePrint version. Before this paper will be used in 
the decision process for the winner of the PHC, we would kindly
asked the authors to analyze the latest version of Catena (Catena
v3.1).

Best regards, Jakob (on behalf of the Catena design team)


They similarly used older versions of Yescrypt, Lyra2, Argon, and 
others, if I am not mistaken.  I think this is no big deal for the
 non-finalists, but  the paper should be updated to reflect the 
current state of all the finalists.

They just mentioned in their conclusion:

"We survey the first round results of the competition [...]"

This might be ok. But they also wrote:

"We contribute to the final selection of the winners by highlighting
the efficiency of each finalist in terms of execution time, memory
consumption and code size."

Which does not make much sense since only the current versions are
considered for the choice of the winner(s).


It is nice to see some new independent analysis, though :-)

Of course. It is always good to see that more and more people are
analyzing PHC candidates!

regards,
jakob
