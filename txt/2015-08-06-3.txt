I happened to read this article yesterday:

http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/8/5/how-do-you-program-a-computer-with-10-terabytes-of-ram.html

which links to:

http://www.davefarley.net/?p=254

which says:

"[...] it is still a lot slower than DRAM, but the gap is closing.
If the marketing specs are to be believed then the new 3D XPoint memory
is about 10 times slower than DRAM"

So not much of a threat yet, but it might be later.  And it might also
be useful for defense, for yescrypt's ROM and such.
