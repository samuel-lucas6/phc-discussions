Hi Bill,

sorry for late reply. Thank you for the notes.

Ad is associated data, which may contain some additional information to be
hashed together with the password (ID, credentials, etc.). I will talk more
about that in the API discussion.

Correct.


Similarly, return error codes for msglen, noncelen, secretlen, adlen, and
m_cost when they are too long.  What is ad?

Will be done.

Shall there be password? There can be any (low-entropy) message to be
hashed.

Will be explained.

Why is the max secret size 32?  Why not be variable, like the password?

Is there need for longer key lengths. Certainly can be variable.

Code should be reformatted to conform to a popular standard.  For example,

The entire code will be refactored.

Optimized and reference code do not clear any secret parameters, making it

Will be added.
