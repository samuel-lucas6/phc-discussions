We should try to eliminate them.

Regarding your idea re: all PHC submissions doing it in the same way,
I'm not so sure.  In each case, the choice might be affected by other
crypto primitives and constructions that a given PHC submission would
use anyway, so that its total complexity is less.  For escrypt, this is
a reason for its non-compat modes to reuse PBKDF2 anyway, just working
around its shortcomings.
