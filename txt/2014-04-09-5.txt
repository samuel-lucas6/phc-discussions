One other thought on Catena-like entries.  RIG seems very similar to
Catena, except that it also XORs data onto memory, rather than
overwriting.  One of the best things about Catena is how easy it is to
analyze.  RIG may have some other benefits, but it loses that
simplicity of analysis.  I think I have to put simplicity of analysis
as a major benefit of Catena.
