So far we support most of the API and minor corrections to the scheme that

Complexity, as we see it, is one of the greatest enemies of security.

In this case, I think it is fortunate that Yescrypt made it as a
recommended solution for situations requiring the defenses it has to
offer.  I think this will be most use cases.

It has been proposed to add another version of Argon2, which is a
combination of Argon2d and Argon2i. In more details, the first half (or so)
of the memory should be filled with data-independent addressing, and the
rest with data-dependent addressing. The motivation is to reduce the
side-channel leakage for 1-pass Argon2d  at the cost of reduced tradeoff
resilience and the overall latency. The drawback of this proposal is
threefold: 1) yet another primitive 2) the side-channel leakage is reduced
but not removed, which still restricts the use case. 3) the tradeoff
becomes more favourable to the attacker.

I agree with 1) and 2), but not 3).  Against brute-force off-line guessing,
a hybrid architecture is just as strong as a purely password-dependent one.


Clearly, such update would make sense only for 1- or 2-pass Argon2d, since
for 3 passes and more Argon2i comes into play.

I agree, but I also feel the use-cases for more than 1 pass are as rare as
the use cases for Argon2i.  Embedded in a TPM chip, Argon2i could help
protect secrets stored in the device.  This is the best use case that comes
to mind.


We think that the drawbacks currently outweigh the positive effect, in
particular we are concerned of the fact that the scheme is weaker than both
existing variants in some scenarios. Still, it can be possible to include
it as a possible extension, though not recommended by the designers but
available to those who desperately want such a scheme.

In what scenario would a hybrid be weaker than Argon2d?

In any case, not merging Argon2d/Argon2i with a new parameter is fine.
This is a non-critical featuer, IMO.
