Here's what I am working on at the moment for mechanical testing:

- I'm manually creating a PHC/limits/<entry>-limits.c file, to specify
input ranges.
- The main.c wrapper now generates test vectors, automatically keeping
runtime per PHS call to under about 0.1s.  The results will be in
PHC/vectors/<entry>-vectors.

Once this is done, I plan to time all the various calls to the PHS,
and then rerun them using:

valgrind --tool=massif phs-<entry>

This creates a table of memory usage vs time.  I should be able to add
them up and report time*average memory, and time*max memory.  Valgrind
can also report cache stats.  Ideally I can get it to tell me total
memory bandwidth to the various levels of memory hierarchy.

Then there's dieharder runs to clean up, though I think we've already
reported all the failures.  After that, there's doing dieharder tests
on the PHS output that is fed into the final cryptographic hash, to
see that there is no major loss of entropy going on during memory
hashing.

That's all I can think of for now.  It will likely take a couple of weeks.
