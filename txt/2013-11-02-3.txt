This seems to be no negligence or incompetence. That might have been the
case if
the hash function had been forgotten or an insecure one had been selected.
The implementation of Triple-DES is more complex than a hash function
and the performance is much more worse.
There is really only one good reason to dothat:  To use the passwords
elsewhere.
So, Adobe seems to use passwords or make them accessible for others.
