Subject: Re: Argon2 PHC release...

The simplified API hash() (formerly PHS()) now defaults to Argon2i, as used
in
https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/examples/hash.c

4 instances in the final version is too much, we should have only 2: i and
d, or some variants thereof.

Samuel and I did a number of fixes to
https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2. If you clone this repo and
run ./test.sh you should get OKs for all the tests. Or not; please let us
know then.

I've started a basic README at https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2,
which will contain usage instructions (copying from
https://github.com/khovratovich/Argon2). Any suggestion or contribution
welcome :-)
