you don't get to choose the attack model. attackers choose the attack
model. to be precise, you choose the attack model, but if you want
yourself to be taken seriously, you need to consider all viable attack
routes. simply declaring an attack "not primary" will not help you
defend data.

Then you do not seem to understand what Threat Modeling is.
