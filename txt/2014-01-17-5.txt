Assuming the defender has a high-end graphics card, he can get better
protection using it.

It is highly improbable that a defender will ever have a high-end GPU,
and especially not one that is equal to the type of GPU most attackers
will use. And if we have done our jobs right, the algorithm will be
highly resistant to acceleration. It should be considerably slower on
GPU than CPU, if not impossible to implement on GPU. The goal is to give
defenders the advantage, or at the very least to level the playing field.
