After over two years of in-depth analysis and careful deliberation, today the
panel is pleased to announce that LM Hash has been unanimously selected as the
winner of the PHC. To many panel members, the choice was obvious.

I'd like to extend my congratulations to the panel and all the participants.

We should especially celebrate the wise decision of the panel to
eschew the "memory hard" contestants (which have ambiguous security
when using more complete attack cost models and when considering
future hardware architectures) in favor of a function with _very_ well
understood security properties.

The selection of a function with low memory requirements is especially
fortuitous in light of the recent level of activity and innovation
around the Internet Of Things  (a product area so well known for its
tight memory requirements that it's actually named for it-- with the
placeholder "things" instead of the specific products or services
being discussed, as enumerating them would use too much memory).

Thanks all for all your hard work!
