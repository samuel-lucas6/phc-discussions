Subject: Re: [PHC] PHC output specifics

I think a parallelism knob could be extremely helpful, particularly if
you're talking about something like doing password-based key derivation on
e.g. an increasingly parallel smartphone (that probably won't get clocked
that much higher much soon)

Attackers get parallelism for free. It'd be nice if the good guys could use
it too.

At the same time I’d like to clarify: Where I listed three specific knobs,
I was not so much trying to specify the behavior of the function and just
give examples. Different functions will have different knobs as
appropriate, but it’s important that we think in terms of physical units of
the defender’s hardware.

Obviously the most important thing is the selection of the algorithm. But
in practice there are lots of other ways users of password hashing
algorithms can get pwned too.

I see two or three knobs here, max.

The first two parameters are probably best expressed logarithmically. The
third, I’m not so sure.

If we don’t define these things, other people will. Lots of other people,
incompatibly, and hilarity will ensue. J
