if you want to cop out, you can choose ones with non-general,
niche uses, and suggest moving them to a special section.

Interesting... I separated the entries into "solid" and "weak", based
on whether I feel they advance the state of the art in a significant
way.  Both Catena and Gambit make the cut, but most don't, IMO.
Script and Bcrypt set the bar pretty high, IMO.

While clearly Catena and Gambit advance the state of the art (RIG does
not - it's mostly a rip-off of Catena without even giving Catena
credit), I might say that an algorithm that runs much slower than
Script, only single-threaded, more or less cache bound, with low
resistance to ASIC (and likely GPU) brute-force attacks, but with a
unique quality (cache-timing attack resistance) not seen in other
algorithms, is a niche algorithm.  I think you might want to re-think
advising the PHC judges to put niche algorithms on their stinkers list :-)
