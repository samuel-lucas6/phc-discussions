Hi Meltem,

I asked you these questions on the panel list, and as I mentioned I'd
like to re-ask them on the public discussions list now:

Is NIST any more likely to standardize an eventual PHC winner that is
based on a NIST-standardized primitive such as SHA-2 than on e.g. BLAKE2?

Similarly, is NIST any more likely to standardize an eventual PHC winner
that is based on an established primitive such as BLAKE2 than on custom
crypto such as what we see in POMELO?

Finally, is it a valid argument for NIST that with proper entropy
bypasses from {password, salt} to PHS() output via an established crypto
primitive, the bulk of the processing may be considered non-crypto and
thus any custom non-crypto like this (e.g., yescrypt's pwxform) isn't a
barrier to standardization?

Thanks,

Alexander
