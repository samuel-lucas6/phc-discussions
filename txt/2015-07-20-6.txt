Thanks to everyone who got us here.

This includes not only the teams that include the winner and recognized schemes, but everyone who submitted, contributed to discussion and analysis and to the panel itself.

I am looking forward to the finalized versions so that I can start using them and advocating adoption.

Cheers,
