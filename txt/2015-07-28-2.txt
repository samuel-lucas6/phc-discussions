Subject: Finalizing Catena, Lyra2, Makwa, yescrypt

Catena, Lyra2, Makwa, yescrypt are PHC's special recognitions. We'll
deliver packages (specs+code) of their final versions in Q3. Meanwhile,
minor changes can be made to the algorithms, but we need to agree on those.

@Submitters of C, L, M, y: Do you intend to make any changes to your
algorithms? If so, which ones?

@Others/panel: What changes would you like to see in the finalists? Why?

Thanks!
