Wikipedia gives 6 transistors for 1 bit of SRAM vs. 28 for 1 full adder:

This sounds about right to me.  Also, the 28 for the full adder will
not layout quite as nicely.

The smallest full adder I heard of (half-analog, weird) is 4 transistors
plus 4 diodes (and other components):

It's probably not suitable for high-speed ASIC.  (I'm toying with the
idea of actually trying it on a breadboard.)

Using canonical estimates for transistor count, a 32x32->64 multiplier

In the logic cells I designed for ViASIC, we had 16 6-T SRAM cells, 4
NAND gates, a DFF, 2 MUXes, and a few inverters.  I'd guess I could
build a custom carry-save adder in the space of the 4 NAND gates,
another in the mux area, and a couple in the flop.  Roughly a 4-to-1
ratio which seems about right, especially when you take the decoders
and read circuits into account.  Maybe 5-to-1, which is in line with
the estimate above.

With 4-to-1, and just a carry-save multiplier, I'd get 32x32x4 = 4K
bits... but you ware saying bytes, right?  Are we having a big-B
little-b communication thing?  I hate those...
