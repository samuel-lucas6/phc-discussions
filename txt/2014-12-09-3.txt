Hi Krisztián, I am trying to understand and summarize your concerns but
when I do they seem like very good reasons for not selecting particular
candidates:

   - Emphasize CPU defense over GPU defense
   - Underdocumented/poorly-specified
   - Unsound cryptographically
   - No good reference implementation
   - Doesn't offer anything novel over existing solutions (e.g. bcrypt,
   scrypt)

These all sound like good reasons to reject candidates to me, and I don't
think the criteria have diverged from the original CFP.
