It focuses on comparing general and security properties. Moreover, it
formally introduces the two attack types garbage-collector attacks and
weak garbage-collector attacks.

interesting analysis. it could be extended with an aspect raised a
while ago, whether the remnants of a hash can be distinguished from
random. that is, can it be identified, if found in memory. this
actually has the same two flavors as GC and WGC attacks:
identifiability of the remnants having or not having the final hash.
