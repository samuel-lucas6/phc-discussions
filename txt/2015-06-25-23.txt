In fact, to fully defeat the attack, it is sufficient to have s or h;
it is not necessary to have both.  (In practice, it may be helpful to
have both for other reasons.)

'h' being preferred over 's', as a system without 'h' would still leak
password information as identical passwords would have the same
side-channel data.

You're right.  Thank you for correcting me.

Side-channels aside, there are other good reasons why per-hash salts are
important to have even in presence of a system-wide secret.
