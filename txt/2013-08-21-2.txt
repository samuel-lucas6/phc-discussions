In crypto mechanisms the term "derivation" has been used for some time, e.g.
"Key Derivation Scheme".  Unfortunately it describes the target, not the
source, so "Password Derivation Scheme" gets it backwards.  Is there an
inverse of "Derivation"?

Having said that, the term PHC already has enough traction that it's probably
too late to change it now.

No, it'd be the Password Hash Bikeshedding Competition.  The arguments would
still be raging five years after the PHC itself closes.
