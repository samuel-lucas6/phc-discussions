When might the target size be one? Well, for example, in a targeted
or on-demand attack, versus the general case of an attacker trying to
re-sell in bulk the weakest passwords in the database. In this case
you might look at what is the average cost to crack just one account.
You can't rely on hiding among millions of salts to make the attack
slower.

Right.  Salting only makes sure work done on one hash can't be re-used
for other hashes.  Salting doesn't make things less secure but in some
scenarios it doesn't add any security either.

This is why we need a layered approach to password hashing / storage.

* We need salting to help slow down parallel cracking of big dumps.

* We need salting to prevent pre-computation (rainbow tables).

* We need personalization keys to add an additional secret that in some
  scenarios (where the key remains secret), can prevent any cracking
  whatsoever.

* We need slow hashes to make repeated guessing costly.

* We need high-memory usage to make parallel guessing costly.

* We need to minimize the reusability of work from one guess on the same
  hash to the next (anti-stream processing).

* Users needs to choose good passwords.


A failure in any of these makes the job of the cracker easier.  Salting
is just *one* protection out of many.  It helps in some situations, it
does nothing in others.
