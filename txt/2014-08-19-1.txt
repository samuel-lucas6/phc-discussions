Does anyone know why the file I get when I download that .pdf attachment in the Gmane archive is 500k larger than the file I attached to the original email?

This is regarding http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.phc/1793

Looks like a Gmane bug.  It's probably reporting the size including
base64 overhead, instead of the original size.

Your original:

$ sha1sum Microsoft-PHC-Passwords14.pdf 
6fdbe09d75edff05f03e2408a3ae36467aa8594d  Microsoft-PHC-Passwords14.pdf

Downloaded from Gmane:

$ head -c 1341846 1793-001.bin | sha1sum 
6fdbe09d75edff05f03e2408a3ae36467aa8594d  -
$ tail -c +1341847 1793-001.bin | od

1627440 000000 000000 000000 000000
1627450

So it's just trailing zeroes.  Should be benign.

The size difference is:

1812670/1341846 = ~1.35
