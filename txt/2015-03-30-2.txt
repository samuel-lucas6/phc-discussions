Instead, we claim that a password hashing function is secure against
attack A if salt satisfies properties P. For instance, suppose that an
adversary looks for a preimage to any of the given set of password
hashes, where salts are stored in cleartext. Iff the salts are unique,
then any password attempt would work for a single hash only (whereas
if the salt repeats for N passwords, a password is essentially tried
for N hashes simultaneously). Thus in this setting salt should be

Great, that’s indeed what’s needed. It would be nice if the winner(s) of PHC would write down such claims in their specs, so that users know what they can do with salt and what consequences they’ll have.

Thank you!
