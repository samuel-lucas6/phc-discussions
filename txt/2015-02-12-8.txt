I'm sure NIST tried quite hard with the SHA-3 competition, but the

standardized by NIST.

I think, this is unfair! When the SHA-3 process started, there was panic 
in the community, especially on the side of the industry. People expected 
SHA-2 to fall as badly as SHA-0 and SHA-1, and where urgently waiting for 
something to replace all the old hash functions. During the time of the 
SHA-3 competition, the confidence in SHA-2 grew, and now there is no real 
interest in SHA-3 any more.

Also not that for many years, the cryptographic community had deep trust 
in the NIST as a fair broker for cryptographic competitions and standards. 
With recent disappointments (if you don't know what i mean, google for 
"Dual_EC_DRBG"), the NIST lost much of its good reputation. Which doesn't 
improve the perception of new NIST standards (SHA-3 or whatever), 
regardless of the quality of the process for these standards.
