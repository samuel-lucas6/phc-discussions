BTW, this pool currently reports:

"Network Hashrate: 1,942.19 KH/s | Pool Hashrate: 955.08 KH/s |
Workers: 179"

955.08/179 = ~5.33 kh/s per worker (maybe many machines are
dual-CPU or bigger?)

1942.19/3.47 = ~560 equivalents of i7-4770K are currently mining
BSTY

Maybe we'll see attempts at more optimized yescrypt code soon -
e.g., AVX2 code is easy to write, likely for some speedup.  I've
been postponing this as it was not essential for PHC at this time
(with other aspects having higher priority), but perhaps folks who
are serious about mining this coin will feel differently.

Wow!  That network hash rate is crazy!  I guess the pool thing really
helped, but with those numbers, maybe there's an admin at some monster
data center somewhere having some fun...

The h/s has been all over the map.  It was 600K/s two days ago, then
down to 300K/s yesterday, and now close to 2,000K/s today.
