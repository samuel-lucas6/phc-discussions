No, not that one.  And I actually recalled incorrectly.  Here's an
excerpt from an email Jeremy sent me in March 2015:

My sadness and anger aside, I appreciated this info.  Thanks, Jeremy.

I am sorry for directly posting an excerpt of a private email to a
public list, but I felt I had to make the info public anyway and I
wouldn't have worded it better.  I hope Jeremy understands and agrees.

So the recent MSR paper was merely referring to an older paper by other
authors.  I don't recall ever seeing the older paper itself, and I did
not read the patent, but I did read (after Jeremy's email in March) the
one-paragraph summary on page 11 in WhatsaSysadminToDo.pdf referenced
above.  It's reference [15] in there.

The other patent, which I also haven't read closely, covers an idea
expressed in IIRC a Microsoft Research paper from several years ago.
In the paper, it's essentially the same idea Steve Thomas proposed
shortly before Passwords12 - a large ROM on a system connected at low
bandwidth just sufficient for defensive use but not for quickly
downloading the ROM.  (I don't have that paper reference handy at the
moment.  I may dig it up and post later, or Jeremy may.)

So I dug up whatever I had on this now, as above.
