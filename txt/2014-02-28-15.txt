submission). I think a prior message to this list claimed that there
should be about 10 or 12 candidates, but that's just an estimate and there
could be dozens of submissions from people who never actively participated
to this list.

Good point.  This also means you still have time to take Solar
Designer's excellent research into why Bcrypt is so difficult for GPUs
:-)  Thus, you could be one of those "influenced" entries.

Basically, if you have a loop where password dependent addressing is
done, just try to do small data reads in it.  Bcrypt does it from the
start, doing 16 byte reads if I am not mistaken.  I'm only doing it in
the second loop, since the first loop in TigerKDF is predictable for
cache-timing-attack resistance, but in the second loop I do 64-byte
reads by default.  I figure that likely makes it around 8X larger
memory for CPU/GPU parity, or around 32KiB vs Bcrypt at 4KiB.
