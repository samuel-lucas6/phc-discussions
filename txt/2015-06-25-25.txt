Not sure if we're talking at cross purposes here, or that having had a
night's sleep I'm a bit more awake, but I think the algorithm would still
be in trouble.

If you pre-hash with constant time, say, global secret s and per-password
data, h, to create, q, say then the access pattern will be a function of
both s and h.  Remember that s is constant and h is picked from a space of,
around, 2^40 (or some reasonable reflection of password strength.

h in this example was the per user salt, assumed to be ~128bit. So even
knowing q, you would not be able to brute force the password without h. A
successful attack would require both a database leak (to get the salt) and
a side channel attack (to remove the password stretching).
