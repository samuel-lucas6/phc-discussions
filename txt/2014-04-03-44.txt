Agree with Dmitry. Ideally submitters should be on the ML, and that's
their own responsibility to register and follow the PHC activity.

On a similar note, can we get a bot /join'ed to #phc that will log
discussion somewhere? I don't habitually hang out there, but it would be
nice to have a log that I could grep for mentions of EARWORM.
