MAXFORM is the scalar equivalent to (and subset of) pwxform.  It's
neither parallel, nor wide, but is otherwise the same.

It would co-exist with Argon2's existing SIMD code.

By existing SIMD code you mean the compression function that includes

E.g. You'd run the MAXFORM in parallel using the otherwise untilized

Yes, that's what he means.  It might make sense to back off to the previous
reduced-Blake2 if the multiplication chains are already done in the scalar
unit.

I agree it's better to use more of the defender's resources.
