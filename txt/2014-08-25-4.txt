Bill,

I'm no expert in this, but:

A reasonable goal would be to have several such GDDR interfaces on
your ASIC.  It is very hard to do!  However, it is doable, at least in
theory.  If you had 512 pins all running at 6Gpbs, you'd have 384GiB/s
bandwidth.  That would probably set a world record for chip bandwidth,
but it's within a factor of 2X of what has been built before.

This is very close to what high-end GPUs and Xeon Phi currently (at
least claim to) achieve - on a 512-bit bus with GDDR5 memory, yes.
Current top GPUs are 288 GB/s to 320 GB/s.  Xeon Phi 5110P is 320 GB/s,
7120P is 352 GB/s.  Yes, these are GB/s, not GiB/s, so your 384 GiB/s
is still ~17% faster.  I think you were subtly wrong about it, though:
6 Gbps probably uses powers of 10, not of 2.  Only 9% faster than
Xeon Phi 7120P, then.  So it's clearly within reach, perhaps with some
overclocking of the lucky ones of those same chips.  I guess some
scrypt-based cryptocoin miners have already been overclocking their GPUs
like that... even though it's 20% higher than the GPUs' 320 GB/s at
stock clocks.  Whether such overclocking is a reasonable thing to do is
another matter, but this being the new world record is fairly unlikely.

What do you think of HMC?  A few months (or even a year?) ago, @jangray
tweeted pictures of prototype FPGA+HMC boards from a technology
exhibition he attended.  I don't recall this reliably now, but I guess
those boards used individual HMCs, so 160 GB/s only (half of what we
have with GPU boards), but perhaps this can be scaled to accessing
multiple HMCs from a single FPGA or ASIC?  How many?

"according to Micron, a single HMC can produce an incredible data
bandwidth of 160GBytes/sec"
"demonstrated interoperability between Micron's HMCs and Altera's
Stratix V FPGAs using a full 16-transceiver HMC link"

I guess a relevant question is: how many suitable transceivers do
current FPGAs have?  From the above, clearly it's at least 16, but if
it's 32+, then 2+ HMCs can be interfaced at full speed from one FPGA,
right?  And how many can an ASIC reasonably have?  Also, would the cost
and/or power consumption of the HMCs dominate anyway, in which case
lowering the number of ASICs wouldn't be all that important?

Four FPGAs and one 160 GB/s HMC on a board, so not that impressive for
our needs yet - but shows that boards with HMCs are already commercially
available.  And given demand, I guess boards with at least as many HMCs
as FPGAs on them can appear as well.
