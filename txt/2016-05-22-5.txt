First of all, a Key Based KDF such as HKDF can also perform key stretching.
Second, key stretching is a function that's part of the password hashing -
it's not identical to it. HKDF for instance consists of two parts:
HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand. The key stretching would be (part of)
HKDF-Expand.
And finally, most people would not put a connection between key stretching
and password hashing.

Hi Maarten,

But I'm not sure that there is a need for one,

Compare the two statements:

    Don't encrypt passwords, hash them. But not with a general-purpose
cryptographic hash function; you need to use a hash function
specifically designed to perform the slow, salted hashing of a
password. This means don't use something like AES or SHA256, but do
use Argon2i.

-----

    Don't encrypt or hash passwords, phash them. For example: Argon2i.

I find myself repeating the same footnotes every time I try to correct
an article or press release about "we encrypt our users' passwords".
My meta-argument is that using the same verb to mean several different
actions is ambiguous and causes confusion for neophytes and opting for
a different verb for every context avoids that problem.

The need for it might not seem widespread, but I'm reasonably sure
that adopting this approach will lead to better user understanding
(i.e. not calling literally everything you can do in cryptography
"encryption").

nor that it will get any traction.

We won't know unless we try. :)
