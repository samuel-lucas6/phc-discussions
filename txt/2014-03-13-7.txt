Servers can't afford hashing for a second and using a GB of RAM in the process

This presupposes either a high rate of password hash verifications or extremely RAM-limited servers.

A service I help run has had peak authentication rates of 1200/sec, so in the worst case that's 1.2TB of RAM. Maybe the servers are extremely RAM-limited, but they donâ€™t have 1.2TB each. :-) In the best case assuming about 10ms/authentication spread over 4 servers that's 300/server and 3 simultaneous, so a max of 3G of RAM, which the servers do, easily, have, but we can't plan for the best case only.
