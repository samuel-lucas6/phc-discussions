Subject: Re: [PHC] Endian Issue in Catfish

Hi Steve,

Thanks for your interest in our design and especially the source code.

The pkhash_slow() was modified from one piece of old code, and it was using
big endian.
I was in a hurry to complete the C ref code to be submitted to the
competition.
That's the reason why it seems a little weird.

We chose little endian to be compatible with Keccak and other minor issues.
It is perfectly fine if you can implement the pkhash in little endian.

Best,
Bo

  I think there is an issue with endian in Catfish. E verywhere in
catfish() it is little
 endian until it gets  passed into pkhash_slow() then it thinks it's big
endian and
 "in" is  "reverse for little-endian". Then is used as little endian.
Although this
 doesn't really matter since the input  is  from keccak. It just seems
weird.
