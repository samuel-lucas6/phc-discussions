Sorry to disappoint you, but it appears they have another nasty
bug in there (and probably more).  It looks like some systems (all 
64-bit?) mine a different blockchain from 32-bit ones (which are 
apparently the majority, due to Windows binary wallet).  I
reported it and provided some detail, so I hope they'll figure this
out and deal with it somehow.

Haha!  That's pretty funny.  I let my son's MineCraft server keep
running, and it's happily mining away on the wrong block chain.

I'll leave it running for the entertainment value :-)
