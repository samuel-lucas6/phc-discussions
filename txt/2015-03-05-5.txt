Subject: The PHS API

Hi.
I think that the wish for a standard API, as brought up by Marsh Ray,
makes it necessary to discuss the PHS API. Just in case anyone would
use it as a base for the new API. In particular I would like to point
out the input parameter  const void *in  . Since this is the password,
declaring it as const strikes me as harmful.
I can see that having one constant password in a testing environment
may make sense. Getting the password erased when calling the
password-hashing function could be seen as a side-effect from the
users perspective, but in light of garbage-collector attacks, e.g.
Heartbleed, it seems to be the only sensible solution.

Sincerely
Sascha Schmidt
