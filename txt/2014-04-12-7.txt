Subject: Withdrawal of the PHC submission Catfish

Dear all,

Due to certain unanticipated administration issues, we regret to tell that
we have to withdraw our design Catfish from the password hashing
competition.
We will remove our design paper from public and close our GitHub repository
soon, and we have asked Jean-Philippe to help us remove related stuff from
the PHC official website.

One thing we can assure you is that this is not due to any
technical/security issues of the design Catfish itself.
The algorithm is still perfectly secure and competitive in our view.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion, and we are sorry we cannot
discuss more details about this.
At last, we would like to thank Jean-Philippe for his help, and Steve and
any ones who provided insightful comments on our design.

Best regards,
Bo Zhu, Xinxin Fan, Qi Chai, and Guang Gong
