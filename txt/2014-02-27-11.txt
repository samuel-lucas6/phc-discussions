If we estimate 1 bit of SRAM to be roughly the same as a 1-bit full
adder

Wikipedia gives 6 transistors for 1 bit of SRAM vs. 28 for 1 full adder:

The smallest full adder I heard of (half-analog, weird) is 4 transistors
plus 4 diodes (and other components):

It's probably not suitable for high-speed ASIC.  (I'm toying with the
idea of actually trying it on a breadboard.)

Using canonical estimates for transistor count, a 32x32->64 multiplier
is more like a 4 KiB SRAM.
