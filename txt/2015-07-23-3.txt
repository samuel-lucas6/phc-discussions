I think I would prefer maxform in both, with the regular reduced-blake2 in
both, although using blamka in both would also be OK.  I'm a big fan of
maxform with or without blamka, and also I would prefer to keep Argon2i
similar to Argon2d, preferably merging the algorithms into 1.  Even though
the addressing in Argon2i is predictable, I do not see any easy way to use
in a GPU against maxform, though I'm no GPU expert.

Unfortunately, it won't work that way.  As it is, MAXFORM does input
dependent S-box lookups (and this provides most of its GPU resistance),
and I was proposing plugging it into 2d such that it'd work on
password-dependent inputs.  For 2i, we need some revision of it, and
it'd provide less GPU resistance.

JP - please keep track of one more tweak requested by several people now
(and which I support) - merging 2d and 2i into one, with a flag or a
tri-state parameter.  Somehow you did not list it in your summary message.
