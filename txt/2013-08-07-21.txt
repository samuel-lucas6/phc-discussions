So it doesn't matter if I count compressions or invocations here.
This doesn't hash the whole chain on each iteration. link != chain

Oh, right. OK I see.

So why then do you say:

A defender with a standard computer has cost ptime*{pmem^2} instead.

In particular, where does he pay pmem^2 ?

(Except possibly with a pathological .prepend or .join implementation)
