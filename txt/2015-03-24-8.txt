Thus, yescrypt v1's output for a shorter length is always a prefix of

for this property.

This test is output from original submission (with special case):
https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/Lenovo_X230_i5_4G/o_len/yescrypt.dat

And now the version 1:
https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/o_len/yescrypt.dat
https://github.com/mbroz/PHCtest/blob/master/output/round2_Lenovo_X230_i5_16G/o_len/yescrypt-sse.dat

So it works as expected.
