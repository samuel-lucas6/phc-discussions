Subject: Links to technical resources for judges

I know there's already ample information available for judging the PHC
finalists, but I'm curious if anyone has any sort of updated analysis of
anything they'd like to share, or just general links of interest that would
be helpful for the judges.

There's been some recent work trying to produce graphs of various
dimensions of performance and efficiency, some of which were controversial.
However I'd definitely like to see more of that sort of thing and think
it'd be very helpful evaluating the candidates.
