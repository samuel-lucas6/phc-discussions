Perhaps we should keep an eye on the 3D chip stacking technology. It’s been discussed for many years, but is just recently starting to come online. https://www.bing.com/search?q=3d%20chip%20stack

E.g. “the CMOSAIC project considers a 3D stack-architecture of multiple cores with a interconnect density from 100 to 10,000 connections per millimeter square” http://www.zurich.ibm.com/news/10/moore.html

Seems like that could represent a pretty big jump in memory bandwidth.

It's proportional to the number of I/Os, which on most ASICs is proportional to sqrt(area).
