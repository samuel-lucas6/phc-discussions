To avoid misalignment, if you ran all 4 for round 1, and then selected
the right one, then all 4 for round 2, then selected the right one,
etc., you'd be doing 4x as many memory operations and you'd need a way
of discarding the memory changes made by the 3 wrong branches. Is this
the attack you're suggesting?

No, I'm saying that a GPU will waste clock cycles while not calculating the
wrong data paths. This is do to it's conditional execution of instructions. If a
thread is not suppose to run an instruction it will do a nop (no operation)
instead.
