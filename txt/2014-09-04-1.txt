I'll still stand by my assertion. A cryptographically strong PRNG
is overkill for a salt.

[...] However, the need for
strong randomness does not come from the saltness, but from the
other, completely orthogonal constraint coming from your specific
scenario.


Even in Bill's scenario a cryptographically strong salt isn't needed.
Usually the notion of something being "cryptographically strong"
involves the PRNG resisting an attacker gathering long sequences of
successive output.

For a 128 bit salt, all that's needed is that for a given seed, there is
no distinguishing attack utilising only 128 bits of the PRNG output.
Even many poor PRNGs are indistinguishable from random when you only
have the first 128 bits of their output (e.g. Mersenne Twister).
