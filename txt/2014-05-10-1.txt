Subject: PHS API copyright?

Google just lost a $1B lawsuit on appeal to Oracle, who claims they
copyrighted the Java API.  We PHC contestants promised to put our code in
the FOSS space, but did the PHC give up any copyright claim to the PHS
function?  We're potentially all infringing!

Just kidding... who would copyright an API?  A more offensive idea hasn't
come across my news feed since the last time a petty dictator gassed his
own people.  Imagine if the copyright on printf lasts 100 years.
