Subject: Re: [PHC] OMG we have benchmarks

These charts look like Lyra2 is still running with 2 threads, and Yescrypt
is still running with 6 rounds rather than a more comparable 2 rounds.

These are pretty pictures, but the benchmarks I ran with a bit more care
showed a very different picture.  I'd hate to see a winner selected based
on nice coloring and one algorithm running 2 threads vs all the rest with
1, and one algorithms running 6 rounds rather than 2.
