Anyway! In the next couple of weeks, we will write an academic paper
introducing a new password scrambler (key derivation function). After
that, I will try to supply you with an abbreviated version of our
extended abstract, if desired.


Sorry, for the long delay. But this work took a little longer than
expected. Nevertheless, we came up with Catena, a new memory-hard
password scrambler based on the bit reversal function. A detailed
description of our scheme is available on eprint
(http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/525).

We hope you enjoy this work, and we look forward to fruitful
discussions, comments, and criticism (on this mailing list).

Kind regards,
Christian
