Subject: PolyPassHash PHS interface

I'm not sure what to do about this one... If I am not mistaken, I
can't call the PHS interface in PolyPassHash until I've called other
functions first to create accounts.  This would explain why it's
returning random hashes every time I call PHS.  For now, I'm dropping
PolyPassHash support, but if anyone can suggest how to integrate this
PHS interface into my generic test vector generation code, I'm all
ears.  There doesn't seem to be any legal parameters I can simply pass
to PHS, like all the others so far.
