This really needs the cross-chart we discussed - memory usage vs. real
time with increasing m_cost and fixed lowest supported t_cost.  From
your charts, it was - and still is - not apparent to me that (or
whether?) POMELO v2 performs so well (as the author claims) at large
memory settings.  And you did not include it in Table 4 ("Ability to
cover real use-case limits"), I guess because it was unclear even to you
that it's competitive for your use case.

Thanks,

Alexander
