One of my concerns with ds is, as you point out, the immaturity of its
design and of its code. There's already a lot to do to make the code
reliable.

Let's not exclude an S-box-based version later, but I'd like to deliver a
first usable release by end of this month.

I understand and agree with your concerns and priorities, but wouldn't
this result in us eventually blessing 3 flavors instead of 2 for little
reason?  Or would "an S-box-based version later" be non-PHC?

<evil>This leaves more room for uses of yescrypt, so why would I mind.</evil>

BTW the code in https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2 is now less
C++-looking, with C-style naming convention, and we're getting rid of
C++isms and misused keywords (working with Samuel on that). We've fixed a
couple of of bugs too.

Yeah.  BTW, your removal of ds is incomplete: you can also remove
"uint64_t x = 0;" and:

    next_block->v[0] += x;
    next_block->v[ARGON2_WORDS_IN_BLOCK - 1] += x;

    state[0] = _mm_add_epi64( state[0], _mm_set_epi64x( 0, x ) );
    state[ARGON2_QWORDS_IN_BLOCK - 1] = _mm_add_epi64( state[ARGON2_QWORDS_IN_BLOCK - 1], _mm_set_epi64x( x, 0 ) );
