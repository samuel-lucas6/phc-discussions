It looks like real password entropy may be even lower than what I found
when trying to compress passwords.  This paper
<http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/B12-IEEESP-analyzing_70M_anonymized_passwords.pdf>
suggests the median password entropy of Yahoo users is only 21.6 bits!

The utility of an additional 6.64 bits seems pretty important to me.
