To increase the latency of tradeoff attacks, I think BlaMka may be used
(along with an un-pwxform chain like this, which serves its different
purpose - hardening non-tradeoff latency and providing some anti-GPU).

If using BlaMka, why extra xform chain?

Oh, there's one more reason: then you don't need to chain your BlaMka's.
BlaMka will be to harden the tradeoff latency only, and the scalar chain
will be to harden the non-tradeoff latency only.

Mostly for the anti-GPU.

Also, in pwxform I tried to maximize the per-bit latency (so that one
round's highest latency output bits are needed by the next round early).
I haven't looked into how optimal or not BLAKE2b's rotate counts happen
to be in this respect (and adjusting them may be bad).

Finally, I suspect the extra chain might allow for a higher number of
sequential multiplies than BlaMka for the same Argon2 performance.  The
instruction issue rate for scalar units may be higher than for SIMD, and
the multiply-hardening rounds may be more closely packed together in
un-pwxform than in BlaMka.  (I think TwoCats might have had this sort of
advantage over yescrypt, although this was in part because TwoCats had
only multiplies, and not S-box lookups, on the scalar chain.)
