I disagree.  If it can be snooped beforehand, it will give an
attacker a head-start and we should not do that.

Ohh, absolutely not, that was just to give the general outline of
the issues involved.

I don't buy your rationale for offloading "during busy", as a means
for load-mitigation, it is no different from just rate-limiting the
password validations in the first place, and the additional complexity
does not seem attractive for so little benefit.

But as I said:  I can be convinced, but it'll take more than that.
