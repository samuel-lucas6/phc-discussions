Subject: Re: [PHC] My votes as a panelist (well, some of them, for now)

And a personal message about my vote:

I had not fully studied all of the candidates. I surveyed certain panel
members about which submissions to look at and evaluated those.

In 20/20 hindsight, I totally overlooked Argon. It was received quite well
by the rest of the panel of judges.

If there was some sort of criminal conspiracy to undermine other
candidates, I personally attest I wasn't party to that either.

This is the first round of judging and we're new at this. Perhaps cut us a
little slack?
