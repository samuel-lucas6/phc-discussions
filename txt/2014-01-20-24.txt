I agree, which is a reason why I think a PHC candidate's builtin "server
relief" support (if present) should be usable for some more advanced
than "pass-the-hash" authentication mechanisms.  Ideally, it should fit
some pre-existing ones.

So if we're moving towards a PBKDF that is suitable for, say, SRP then the
"server relief" part of the PBKDF is pretty much redundant, is it not?

If it'd have to exactly match a PBKDF defined as part of e.g. SRP, then
indeed it won't be a new PBKDF and thus not relevant to PHC.  What I
meant is that we could have a new PBKDF that would otherwise fit an
existing authentication mechanism, either because that mechanism was
defined for arbitrary PBKDFs to be substituted into it, or with this
being the only deviation from its existing definition.

Have we had a discussion on the PHC candidates in reference to password
auth'd key exchange mechanisms as yet?

I think not yet, but I think they should just fit in.
