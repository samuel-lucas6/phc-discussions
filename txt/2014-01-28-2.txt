You can get decent bit reversal speed using PSHUFB, by reversing up to
32 4-bit chunks per cycle.

Yes, but unfortunately this adds overhead of going from scalar to vector
and back (we need to bit-reverse a single 32-bit or 64-bit value), and
SIMD instructions generally have lower throughput than scalar ones.  Yet
it might be the fastest approach.  Will need to benchmark.

Considering other architectures have native
bit reversal instructions, it may be an acceptable solution compared to
an ad hoc permutation.

I agree.
