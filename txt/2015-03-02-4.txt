The comparisons are more difficult for the entries that aren't 'sequential
memory hard', e.g. Catena's lambda variable. I'd like to see a
normalisation of these entries to be the number of invocations of the hash
primitive. You then have two independent variables 'memory' and 'hash
invocations' and the dependent variable is 'time' or 'bandwidth'.

Also looking at the numbers for the <= L1 and <= L2 memory sizes (for the
benchmarking machine).
