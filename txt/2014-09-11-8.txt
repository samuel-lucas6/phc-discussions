Given p and q you can do:
e = 2 ** cost
e' = 2 ** cost (mod (p-1)*(q-1))
x ** e = x ** e' (mod p*q)

So it was known that you can modulus the exponent and have it run in constant
time, in comparison to the cost factor.

You could pick the cost to be 2 ** 128. Without p and q you can't test a
password.
powConst = powm(2, pow(2, 128), (p-1)*(q-1))
hash = powm(password, powConst, p*q)
but you could just do HMAC(password, secretKey)

Sorry but even if you came up with the perfect server-specific shortcut,
HMAC or
encryption with a secret key is better.

If you don't know the secret, you can't do anything.

Huh? I don't think that anyone is proposing using Makwa with cost 2^128.

I was picking an absurd number to prove a point that apparently was known. I
guess the escrow should have tipped me off that we don't see eye to eye on what
we think is secure.

I stand corrected, not broken, but my opinion is this is bad.
