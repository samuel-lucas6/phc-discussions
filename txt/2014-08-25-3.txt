Subject: Pleco and Plectron - two provably secure password hashing algorithms

Hi all,

Here are two provably secure password hashing algorithms we designed.
You can get our draft paper and reference source code at

   - https://about.bozhu.me/paper/pleco-plectron.pdf
   - https://github.com/bozhu/Pleco


About the name:

Pleco or Plecostomus is a kind of catfishes that is very popular among
aquarists, as Pleco fishes help keeping water clean. The word Plecostomus
itself means folded mouth.


Some features of our password hashing algorithms:

   - Alternatively apply Keccak and Rabin to intermediate states, in order
   to provide
      - provable security of both one-wayness and collision resistance (of
      the internal hash function and overall designs)
      - the composition of asymmetric and symmetric components that often
      makes the cryptanalysis much harder (analogous to ARX ciphers and IDEA
      cipher).
   - Employ ROMix (without BlockMix) to provide sequential memory-hardness.
   - Can use unfactored Mersenne composite numbers rather than RSA moduli
   in Rabin in order to
      - speed up internal time-consuming steps
      - use the password hashing algorithms in cryptocurrencies for
      proof-of-work/space.
   - Tune memory and time usage via cost parameters.


Any feedback is welcome.
Thanks.

Best regards,
Bo
