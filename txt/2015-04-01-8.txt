Subject: Re: [PHC] OMG we have benchmarks

Great work! I think it is what we need.

Just there must be proper parameter choice.

For Argon2d the memory is looped over <t_costtimes, and t_cost=1 is
minimally secure and recommended.

For Argon2i the memory is looped over <t_costtimes, and t_cost=3 is
minimally secure and recommended.

For Argon the memory is looped over <2*t_cost+1times, and t_cost=3
is minimally secure and recommended.

Argon and Argon2 do not have other parameters that affect the
performance crucially (apart from multithreading).  However, the other
schemes do, and they must be listed (number of rounds in the internal
function, specific flags, etc.). For fair benchmark comparison, the
designers must choose some recommended set of parameters, explicitly
claim its security, and yield it for measurement.

Well, it was just test run, but once it is already here:

(I'll run all algs up to 8GiB but it will take long time -later)

  (So it will not match your calculation exactly but it must be very close.)
