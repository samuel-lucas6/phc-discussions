At a minimum, I should probably modify the simple API (my standard one) to
use t_cost for the outer loop, rather than the cache/DRAM bandwidth
adjustment, and not give the simple API control over that ratio.  That
would make it behave as users expect, with t_cost simply increasing
runtime, and m_cost increasing memory (and runtime in my case).  The full
API could have both.
