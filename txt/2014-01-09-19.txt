Can I mention another thing which bugs me, now that I've got started ?

The word "random" is not in our dictionary.

We have three parts to work with:

The password, which contains entropy, but which is not random, certainly
not from invocation to invocation.

Salt(s), that can be random, or more likely least pseudo-random,
but we should assume that the attacker knows it.

The algorithm, which is deterministic[1], and which the attacker also
know -- and can optimize.

Please use the word "random" sparesly, most of the time it is unwarranted.
