Subject: Re: [PHC] Interest in specification of modular crypt format

We are definitely interested in including all necessary formats to the spec
and the reference implementation, to ease the correct use of Argon2 and
make the incorrect use more difficult, in turn.

We are ready to implement the proposed encoding standard in the code, or
help to integrate, say, Thomas' code into the reference implementation.

There must be some simple and robust API coming with the format, for example
 GenerateHash(NewPassword, UserData) -(Digest, Salt, UserData)
 VerifyHash(Password,UserData,Digest,Salt) -true/false
