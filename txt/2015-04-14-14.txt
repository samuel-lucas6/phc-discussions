There is also an potential interoperability angle (if the password hash 
"database" is used by multiple consumers or needs to be migrated without 
forcing users to change their cleartext. Choices in which to use don't 
always help with that.

So I want one winner that's a drop-in upgrade for the vast majority
of the uses of Bcrypt/Scrypt/PBKDF2/SHA-1/MD5/crypt(3) out there
today.

Agreed.

Though personally I don't mind too much if we end up with different 
algorithms for the PDKDF2 (key derivation) replacement use cases versus 
"password hash" use cases.
