"with a strcmp() call": should we expect all strings to be null-terminated?

In the context of the C crypt() call, the strings are null-terminated;
such is the existing API. In other contexts, strings are not necessarily
null-terminated or even "terminated" (e.g. in C# or Java, this notion
makes no sense), but there would not be a strcmp() function either.


More generally, the traditional crypt() API merges both functionalities
(password registration, and password verification) into a single
function call. Personally, I would find a two-function API clearer. But
that crypt() API (or its reentrant counterpart crypt_r()) is firmly
entrenched and won't disappear any time soon, so I think it is important
to support it. Hence the dedicated section in the spec.


add "The identifier for Argon2ds is 'argon2ds'"?

I have added it to the spec.
