Good.

A cryptographically-random byte sequence or two would also be useful for
test vectors. 

My view is that PHS( ) should not interpret the sequence as any character
code whatsoever.  Nothing to mishandle.

"Dennis E. Hamilton" <dennis.hamilton@....orgwrites:

The ASCII/non-ASCII about desirable test vectors suggest that being
character set sensitive is permissible.

I don't think it suggests that at all.  The purpose of test vectors is
to check the correctness of implementations.  One plausible way to mess
up an otherwise-correct implementation is to mishandle inputs containing
non-ASCII characters. Therefore non-ASCII test vectors are desirable.

I would amend the recommendation by explicit calling for some test
vectors containing embedded null bytes.
