OK, then all the hybrid designs are *not* cache timing resistant.  However,
they all happen to be better at *defending the password* than any of the
cache-timing resistant algorithms, even when the attacker has cache-timing
data.

we've been through this, and you are wrong. cache timing attack might
reveal data that otherwise would not be accessible. it is not about
breaking the resource-requirement. to do cache timing or other timing,
you don't even need the password hash, you might infer the password
solely from timing information. that is a serious breach. i'm kind of
embarrassed that we need to discuss that in the 21st century. all new
designs are cache timing resistant (or ~ enabled), let it be keccak,
salsa, curve25519, etc. i'm very frustrated by this topic.
