Bill,

In fact, once we add low-level parallelism we also need something very

I don't know how exactly you were adding SIMD (as an experiment), but
please note that occasional data mixing between the lanes is a must,
since otherwise it becomes possible to compute the whole heavy part of
the KDF as a few sequential portions, one per lane, with the memory
needs reduced accordingly (it'll be number-of-lanes times smaller).
(This is similar to how scrypt's p>1 allows for computation with less
memory when the parallelism is not fully made use of as such.)

For the random access portion of computation, it is also important that
the random index depends on output of all lanes in the most recent block
computed.  Otherwise some of the lanes may finish computation later.
