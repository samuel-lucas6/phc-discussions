Subject: Re: [PHC] PHC status report

this is the actual information you based your decision on? i'm pretty
sure one of you put this document together in one afternoon. i see no
reason why would anyone hope to learn anything here after this. i can
only hope the crypto community knows better than trusting a false
sense of authority provided by an acronym (PHC), and chooses to ignore
this non-information. if not, you are welcome to choose your own
candidates as winners, and celebrate.
