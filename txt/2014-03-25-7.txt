​Justin has a pdf paper on the github link.  Part of his threat model is
that the attacker cannot read arbitrary memory on the server.  He discusses
what he proposes are advantages of the secret sharing scheme over storing a
simple master secret in memory.

Personally, while I think the idea is really rather novel, I'm not
convinced the advantages over storing a single master secret in memory are
particularly significant in most contexts.  It's hardly uncommon for a
security team to manage a small list of "master" keys.  Having said that,
the PHC is currently running because as a species we can't convince people
to pick non-trivial passwords, so in that light the secret sharing scheme
to store passwords may arguably be reasonable.
