I think it is hard for me to deal with real people in any sort of
understanding way about their code in a review of candidates.  I would
prefer not to deal with entries where I might easily offend the
author, given that I tend to be more offensive than most people.

So, please feel free to send me a note publicly or privately if you
would prefer that I not review the code in your submission, either
with a reason or without one.  I wont even state why I'm skipping an
entry.

In case your code is not meant to be a solid framework for a
production ready password hashing scheme, that is a good excuse.  If
your entry is more of a proof of concept, that is a good excuse.  If
you feel your paper and concept are solid, but the code is not yet
ready for prime-time, that is a good excuse.  I'm really just poking
at the code, and mostly looking for security flaws, though I'm trying
to also say what I like about each scheme.

However, if you consider your code ready and up to the challenge of a
big dork like me attacking it, I look forward to the review!  I need
practice finding weaknesses in code anyway, since I've signed up for
the Security Team at CipherShed, to help insure their code is
back-door free.

Bill
