Nice study.

Argon v2. is also not benchmarked. It is interesting to see how it
performs, should be much more efficient than Argon v1.

Alex

They did not test it with significant men size either...

Hi all,

thanks to the authors for the benchmarking paper. Nevertheless, we do
not agree with the results for Catena since the authors in the paper
did not consider the current version of Catena (Catena v3.1) which can
be found here:

They refer to the version from December 2014 which does not contain
the latest tweaks such as:
 - reduced-round version of blake
 - additional random layer
 - changed initialization phase
 - removed SHA-512 from the parameter recommendations for the underlying
   hash function
 - ...

They also ignored the instance Catena-DBG, which was already mentioned
in the ePrint version. Before this paper will be used in the decision
process for the winner of the PHC, we would kindly asked the authors
to analyze the latest version of Catena (Catena v3.1).
