Bill,

    In 2.1 Simplified NoelKDF, the statement ...

    value = value*(mem[prevAddr++] | 3) + mem[randAddr++];

... is equivalent to ...

  switch ( mem[prevAddr++] | 3 )
  {
    case 0 : value = mem[randAddr++];
break;
    case 1 : value = mem[randAddr++] + value;
break;
    case 2 : value = mem[randAddr++] +               (value << 1);  break;
    case 3 : value = mem[randAddr++] + value + (value << 1);  break;
    default :
  }

... which is surely the route an attacker would take.

Cheers,
Gary
