Ah, now I see what epixoip means. I don't think, this comes even close
to a justification for *not* using salts.

I didn't say it was a justification not to use salts. I said the
opposite. I said salts were necessary, but insufficient on their own. In
other words, an algorithm must not rely on solely upon salting. In other
other words, something like sha256(s.p) is insufficient.
