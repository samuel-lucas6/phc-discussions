I guess I should of just posted code in my first message: 
https://github.com/Sc00bz/break-schvrch

This takes about 3 minutes to run. With SSE or AVX it will be
faster but this is a nice PoC. Note that the generation only needs
to be done once per m_cost and once for each t_cost when m_cost is
zero.


Wow, you're good!  Really good... You considered *this* code too ugly
to post?  Generating the XORs and compiling them totally beats the
speed of what I was going to do (compute them on the fly as matrices).
 I see that I need to try and be an even more evil attacker :-)

While I have had some fun in attacks on this algorithm, it does bother
me that you've written over 500 lines of excellent code where I see no
bugs in order to attack a 117 line program with a lot of bugs.  At
least we got to practice our attack skills.
