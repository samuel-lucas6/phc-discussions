I'm curious if there was any period of time since the inception of the salt that it was considered "public".

Thatâ€™s how /etc/passwd got its name. World readable.

If we would assume the salt to be secret, we should not call it a "salt". To avoid confusion, it would then deserve to be called a "key".

I'm curious if there was any period of time since the inception of the salt that it was considered "public".

But no, the salt is better considered as "sensitive" and treated in the same respect as the password hash.

I guess the outcome of this thread is that side channel resistant candidates are compatible with public salts? For the (limited?) applications that require a public salt?
