Grammar fail. That should read "Solar observed that it was possible
split the arena into W=4 sections and divide it across multiple
machines, each of which needs only the first section and one other."

This would complicate the attacker's job, but it wouldn't slow down
the resulting machine much.  Just as you add an extra 1MiB at the end
so you don't have to worry about overflowing memory, each node would
just add one more work area at the end of their memory.  Since each
node has multiple GiB, adding one more MiB is no biggie, though it's
inconvienient (for example, memory comes in nice 2^n sizes, not 2^n +
1 sizes).

The hashes all being in lock-step is nice for the attacker, but each
hash then just has to wait until the memory it needs is finally
available, and they all start when they're ready.  This does take
quite a bit more control logic and would slow it down, but it's less
than 2X-ish, I think.

You're not the first author to feel it would be too much like Solar
Designer's work to make a nice improvement.  My TwoCats is more his
than mine at this point.  However, I have no shame :-)

EARWORM is well differentiated from yescript, IMO.  It is a slimmer
simpler special purpose tool.  The reliance on AESENC instructions and
the super fast read-only hashing sets it apart.  My theoretical attack
boarders on a banana attack, but I think it's worth keeping in mind.
I wouldn't make the change you're suggesting in response to it.  I
really do like EARWORM the way it is.

I love to consider custom ASIC attacks.  Chip architectures is kind of
my thing.  However, ASIC attacks are becoming more expensive all the
time.  Fewer and fewer attackers can afford the latest and greatest
custom silicon.
