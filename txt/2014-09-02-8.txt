I do believe that basic input checking should be part of the reference
design.

two observations.

1. no, at this stage, we don't need input checking at all. this is not
a library, but a reference. that is, documentation of the algorithm.

2, even in a library, i suggest using only assert-s, if at all. such a
low level subprogram does not have any better means of communicating
an error condition that should not happen in the first place. it is
the responsibility of the caller to use correct parameters.
