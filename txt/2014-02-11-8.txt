Subject: Is bandwidth all that counts?

Having submitted my NoelKDF with it's multiplication compute-time
hardening, I am now wondering if the compute time we force an attacker
to spend matters at all.  An attacker will simply add password hashing
cores, which are close to free, to his FPGA or ASIC, until his memory
bandwidth is full.  If I force him to spend a full second to write and
then read 4GiB once (which I do), he'll just run 5 of my hashing cores
in parallel on an FPGA and fill it's 40GiB/sec memory bandwidth, doing
5 guesses per second, so who cares that I forced him to spend as long
as me computing the hash?

Now the reverse is not true - if we spend time on a complex hash
function instead of filling memory rapidly, an attacker will be more
efficient, maxing out his memory bandwidth while we don't, and that
ration is pure win for the attacker.

It seems to me that the important thing is to fill memory as rapidly
as possible, wasting as little time as feasible just doing
computations rather than reading/writing memory.  NoelKDF is pretty
respectable in this regard, filling memory on my development machine
at about 5GiB with 1 thread, and 10GiB with 2 threads.  However, the
machine is probably capable of over 20GiB/sec.
