Sorry about being noisy.  I'm just looking for every opportunity to push
my primary point about the design of memory-hard KDFs: they should be
fast, fill lots of memory, and any CPU cycles wasted on computing a
crypto-strength hash per memory location is a waste of time.


"All of our methods for doing this involve finding some function F()
which approximates a random function and which requires roughly 2^t
work to compute." -- https://www.schneier.com/paper-low-entropy.html

It is quite hard so show such a behavior for a algorithm F() which is
not based on a cryptographic primitive. Moreover, the random function
approx. property is crucial since a cryptographic key is assumed to be
random.
