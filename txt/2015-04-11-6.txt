Hi.
If you plan on updating this, you may want to rerun the
endianess-support test for catena. Most of the functionality is now
endianess independent. Keyed hashing and key generation still rely on
endianess detection. Sadly I didn't have any access to actual
big-endian hardware, but it worked as expected on a emulated ppc.
Thank you for your great work. It's really helpful.

Sincerely
Sascha Schmidt(on behalf of the Catena team)
