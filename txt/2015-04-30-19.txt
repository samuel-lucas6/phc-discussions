It's good news that attackers probably also can't use Haswell to attack

faster.  It's bad news that defenders can't benefit from Haswell either.

So the conclusion so far stays the same: need to specifically tune
pwxform for 256-bit or wider S-boxes to have it run faster on Haswell,
if desired.  (This is easy to do, and is within currently specified
yescrypt, as I've already demonstrated by trying 512-bit.)

Thanks for letting me have access to you Haswell machine last year.  I
tuned TwoCats for Haswell a bit, and found that in-cache hashing sped up
considerably.  When I added the small unpredictable memory reads, I lost a
lot of that speed-up, however.  Also, the external memory bottleneck did
not significantly change, so I was not able to speed up large memory
hashing significantly.  For a default I chose 8-lane hashing (256 bits) to
be more ready for the future, at a cost of giving attackers more
parallelism than the defender in the short-term.  It's a tough call...
