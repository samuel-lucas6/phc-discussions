That's the approach I prefer (see my earlier thoughts about allowing a final
round of updates for the top three, before a single best-of-breed is chosen).
Argon2 is such an obvious improvement, it seems odd to keep it out so that the
decision has to be made on a previous-generation version.  Or, more
worryingly, that the decision on Argon might be made on the assumption that
what'll be adopted is actually Argon2, blurring the line over what's being
decided on.

(Apologies to Jean-Philippe, who started off with a competition and is now
 running a soccer match :-).
