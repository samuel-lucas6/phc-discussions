Subject: A silly (?) consideration for script-friendly hashes

If people are planning on having client-side offload, or, more
generally, if whatever hash wins ends up with a highly optimized
implementation in web browsers, there may be a problem: anyone who can
get people to leave their browsers pointed at pictures of kittens that
compute hashes in the background effectively has a big network of
password hashers.

This can be mitigated: in addition to salt, a hash function could take
a domain as input.  Then web browser interfaces could enforce a
same-origin policy on the domain parameter.

(This adds minimal implementation complexity: just hash the domain in
with the salt before using it to hash a password.)
