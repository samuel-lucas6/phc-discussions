I thought about reporting this as a bug in the various entries that try to
clear a password or memory using memset, but it still conveys the intent of
the author.  When we get down to just a few entries left standing, I think
the authors should tweak their entries to do a better job clearing memory.

I like my way :)
...
        // Clean up
        // TODO: find a secure wipe function
        memset(data, 0, sizeof(data));
        memset(key,  0, sizeof(key));
        memset(mem,  0, sizeof(uint32_t) * DATA_SIZE * memSize);
...

P.S. I am aware that my function "sha512Block()" doesn't clear sensitive
data.
