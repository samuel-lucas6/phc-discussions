As you pointed out, there may be language-related bugs in Java code too,
and here's a relevant example:

It is important that cryptographic functions are defined to operate on
bytes, not characters. Otherwise, the definition of such functions would
depend on the definition of what a character is, and how they are
represented, which could be as much as the entire Unicode standard.

When it comes to arithmetic operations on integers, results are defined
unambiguously in Java, unlike in C. It is even possible to get
unambiguous behavior of floating point operations (if someone seriously
decided to use them in cryptography) by using strictfp modifier. The
above mentioned bug was caused by incorrect representation of a Unicode
string as bytes, which is not what a hash function should be about
anyway.

Fair enough.
