Jeremy,

I appreciate your quick feedback.  I'll go back and improve the document
further to address these issues.

The Tabby PAKE scheme is out of context for PHC, so it is not part of the
competition.  This was good motivation to do the writeup, though!

Best of luck to everyone =)

I really enjoyed a read through of your paper.  I found it very easy to

use of Snowshoe Elligator.

   Off-line dictionary attack resistance: Passive and active attackers

The last 3 words indicate you mean offline attack from inspecting protocol
messages. Can you please clarify this and in the same section please
explain the properties of an offline attack against the validator database?

3.3.4 discusses offline dictionary attack where the validator database is
known. But then 3.4.1 goes back to discuss dictionary attack resistance
only in terms of protocol messages.

I don't want to minimize any advantages, but I think going to extra
lengths to differentiate these two attack modes does a great service to the
average user of the scheme.

Thanks for developing all this and sharing with us!
