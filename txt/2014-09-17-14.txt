This is why we see these submissions.

P.S. Schvrch is not in this category. As it is not an actual
branch. In x86 SIMD you do a compare then xor (compare sets it to
all 1s or all 0s). With GPUs, they would set a conditional variable
(compare) then conditionally run bitwise invert (one instruction).
Note that a branch in x86 takes two instructions compare and 
conditional jump. Both SIMD and GPUs use two instructions with
neither being a jump.


Thanks for the link.  Very cool.

The current implementation is not in this category, but clearly the
author intended it to be.  He describes branching as cyclomatic
complexity in the attached paper.  I suspect we'll see something more
like the others in the next revision.

I read a bit about GPU computation in the face of conditional branches
here:

http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2103809&seqNum=4

It sounds like in the case of Adobe, they'd have to do a SHA256 for
all the cores needing to do one, then a SHA384 for another 1/3, and
finally SHA512 for the remaining 1/3.  This would take longer, though
not 3X longer, because SHA256 runs faster than SHA512.

So, 3 cases, and a max of 3X longer in Adobe's case.  This is using
the "divergance" feature, which likely has some overhead.  They also
support a "prediction" features where every core executes both sized
of an if statement in sequence, but the effects of thost statements
are supressed in one or the other block.

I think having very many cases might provide good defense.  I just
auto-generated over 13,000 hashing functions that do an
AND/OR/ADD/SUB-XOR-ROTATE.  The problem I see is that each looks very
similar.  I choose two "mixing" operators which are permutations and
reversible, and a non-linear operation.

However, a GPU could attack my 13,000 functions is a simple manner.
They could write a single function that computes which operator is
used in each place, and then execute the small case statements when
they are used.  I think this could dramatically reduce the 13,000X
factor I was hoping for.

There are only maybe 30 different instructions that need to be
executed, at least if the shift distance is computed rather than
embedded in the op-code.  I don't see what would stop a GPU from
taking maybe a 100X speed hit to "interpret" 13,000 different small
functions in parallel.

Still, if we could put the hurt on GPUs by 10-100X, that's worthwhile.
