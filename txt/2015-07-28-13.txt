Here's a great link to radix-sort on GPUs
<https://code.google.com/p/back40computing/wiki/RadixSorting>.  These guys
can radix-sort 1 billion 32-bit hashes per second on a $100 GPU (GTX 480).
After that, finding collisions is a linear pass, and can be done massively
in parallel at full memory bandwidth.

Thanks for the link, Bill. But after the list of hashes is sorted, a collision 
with a specific hash could be detected with an O(log n) binary search, more 
quickly than an O(n) linear search.
