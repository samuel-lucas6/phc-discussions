To Greg's excellent summary I would just add a couple of further points, probably all have been mentioned before.

While this sounds dramatic, and is technically a cryptographic weakness, it's not as big of an impact as it sounds. It's a loss of 3.2 bits of security which could be approximately compensated for by increasing the minimum password length by a single character.

Just to add to the discussion: NIST does have attempted to measure the
number of bits a character would have in its SP.800.63-2, Appendix A
(http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-2.pdf)

By their estimates, each character adds ~1 bit of security after we pass
the threshold of 8 alphanumeric chars, even if we assume that the system
validates that the password is not in a dictionary and follows good
composition rules (see Table A.1).

These estimates may certainly be too pessimistic (and I tend to believe
so), but, by their analysis, 3 bits is a lot :)

(Note that this is not intended as an argument against side-channel
resistance, but only to say that, when dealing with passwords, every bit
counts).

BR,

Marcos.
