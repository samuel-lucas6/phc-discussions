The issue here is the hidden pebble: In the pebble game we need
temporary storage for the computed result.
For example, take a bipartite graph. Then your parallel game lets it
be done in one step, but this is only true if you have N processors.
What's needed is limiting the number of pebbles in each step to k,
where k is the number of processors.

Circuit complexity is probably what we really want to deal with.

maybe worth checking how catena performs in this model.

Sorry, for the long delay. But this work took a little longer than
 expected. Nevertheless, we came up with Catena, a new memory-hard
 password scrambler based on the bit reversal function. A detailed
 description of our scheme is available on eprint
 (http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/525).
