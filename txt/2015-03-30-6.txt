This really needs the cross-chart we discussed - memory usage vs. real
time with increasing m_cost and fixed lowest supported t_cost.  From
your charts, it was - and still is - not apparent to me that (or
whether?) POMELO v2 performs so well (as the author claims) at large
memory settings.

Yes, I'll plan to look into this soon.

And you did not include it in Table 4 ("Ability to
cover real use-case limits"), I guess because it was unclear even to you
that it's competitive for your use case.

It is not there because I did not find any mention that POMELO can be used
directly as a KDF in the paper (and the use case is for KDF).
The garbage-collector attack paper http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881 also
mentions that it is not KDF in Table 4.

Could authors clarify that?
