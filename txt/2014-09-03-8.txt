 Is this why you included a ROM in Gambit?

no, i wanted a second factor in the auth scheme, namely the "have",
and i wanted it to be relatively hard to steal. not that i achieved
this goal, because stealing a ~100MB file is not particularly
difficult these days. not much more difficult than stealing a 32 byte
file.
