I Googled Blind Hashing, and the top result is a patent titled Blind  
Hashing.  At Google, we're forbidden from reading patents, so I did not  
even >read the summary.  Is your idea patented, or was this just a  
random unrelated patent?

Yes, it is mine. The 2nd or 3rd result are good alternatives if you're  
forbidden from reading patents.

If practicing a 'see no evil' theory, maybe Google should let you set a  
preference on your account to not show Google Patents in the results!
