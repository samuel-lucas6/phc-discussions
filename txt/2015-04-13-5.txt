Why only have one winner? Why not choose several winners with various 
trade-offs based on need?

Malkwa is near to my heart-- having a class of approach that I'm fond
of, but I think it would only be selected as a winner because it is
the only function of its type in the contest.

If I'd offered a Malkwa competitor it would have had information
theoretic security for delegation (in exchange for making some
tricks/performance worse). I suspect in the Bitcoin space we may
someday deploy something like Malkwa for some applications (in
particular; access keys for hardware wallets that don't have enough
computational power to perform meaningful hardening on their own), but
we'd only prefer it over more ordinary hardening functions if it
bought us information theoretic security, which allow worryfree
delegation of computation to completely untrusted parties.
