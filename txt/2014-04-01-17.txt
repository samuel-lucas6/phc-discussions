Thank you - this is high praise :-). I felt a bit sheepish submitting
informally-stated conjectures for some claims that I felt ought to be backed
by theorems, but seeing that even some of my favorite designs are supported
by far less analysis alleviates my impostor syndrome considerably.

I feel the same way.  I can tell from your entry that you're one of
the real hackers.  I didn't read it before because authentication
servers isn't an area I'm particularly interested in.  It was a
pleasant surprise.  My own paper isn't in the same class.  Honestly,
I'm worried EARWORM may out-perform TwoCats per thread, which is the
only category I'm hoping to "win".
