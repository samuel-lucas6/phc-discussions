A correction:

Here's a CPU attack on AntCrypt (as I understand it): define all
possible two-function groups.  For 16 original functions, this will
result in 256 dual-function functions, and if they're as tiny as they
currently are they will probably still fit in a CPU's L1i cache.  Now
you can define a dual-AntCrypt, testing two candidate passwords at a
time, and using the CPU core's parallel processing capabilities (SIMD,
multiple issue, super-scalar) it'll likely run no slower than a single
AntCrypt does.  So you get a 2x performance boost for the attacker.
Moreover, the cost of conditional branches is amortized,

This is true, but ...

so the speedup might be slightly higher than 2x.

... this is not.  We replace two branches and two functions with one
branch and one dual-function, which is exactly 2x speedup (at best).
