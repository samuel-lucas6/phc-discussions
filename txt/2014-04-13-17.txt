I read most of your link, and wow!  That's what the whole world needs!
 It's a serious shame that we don't have the flexibility to write our code
and then specify the password hashing algorithm later.  The PHC has a
significant opportunity to change this situation, and learning from your
example sounds like a good idea to me.
