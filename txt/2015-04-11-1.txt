Do we want to continue benchmarking Argon2d and Argon2i?  It is useful for

Like you say, it's useful for reference, and we may be learning new
things from discussions around Argon2 - e.g., it prompted us to converge
to a narrower range of multiply vs. add latency estimates.

I find Argon2 to
be good work compared to Argon, and generally I don't care much for rules
when they hurt the world, so my preference is to drop Argon, and allow
Argon2 to go forward.  Is this possible?

JP replied about Argon2.  Unfortunately, no.

"Luckily," it has that excessive parallelism issue, which would have
prevented me from supporting Argon2 as a winner anyway.  Of course,
others on the panel could have felt differently.  But anyway, the panel
decided not to accept Argon2 for the reasons JP cited.

The same goes for the new Catena version, and I'd also like to allow them
to add any H hash function they need to, including the reduced Blake2b
single-round hash.

As far as I can tell, this is already in PHC.

I think the world would be better off with Argon2i and
Catena2 duking it out for the cache-timing-resistant category, and Lyra2,
Yescrypt, and Argon2d duking it out for the Scrypt upgrade category.

I agree.  And POMELO is also a competitor in the latter category, for
those who want simpler and self-contained.
