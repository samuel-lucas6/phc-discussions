Andy Lutomirski (at Thursday, December 5, 2013, 2:26:19 AM):
Using 2^f_time as the iteration count seems unnecessarily restrictive
-- is there any reason not to just use f_time?

IMO such things should not be part of the algorithm unless intrinsic,
and also should not be part of the submission. it is part of the
interface.

but if we are at it, this could be used as a sort of middle ground
parametrization: take f_a and f_b parameters, and use f_time = f_a <<
f_b . this grants fine control over f_time even if f_a and f_b are
small, like bytes. but still scalable up to ridiculous levels
(255*2^255).

but again, this is part of the interface, and not the algorithm.
