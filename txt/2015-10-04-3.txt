Subject: PHC on GitHub

Hi!

Just created the organization https://github.com/P-H-C
and the repo https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format

The org will eventually include the final Argon2 as well as the special
recognition algorithms.

Will add panel members as org members.

Any suggestions welcome!
