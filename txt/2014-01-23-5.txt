In contrast, Catena-3 already is optimized for only using 1/4 of the

 This observation lets me say with confidence that in timing-resistant
mode, Catena-3 is simply the best of the three, without having to add
any disclaimers about using less memory than the others.

Now your implementation still needs to be optimized. 

Yes. You are right, the current reference implementation is a little bit
slowish. :-)

I really do believe you should have a version optimized to be
multiply-time-limited in the inner loop with a simpler faster hash
function than Blake2.  That would increase your memory useage 10X, so
you'd also have to use larger block sizes.

Maybe you are right. :)


Please tell me your guys are at least trying this.  If not, would you
mind if I do a "friendly fork" of Catena, minimally modified to be 10X
faster, and compute-time hardened against ASIC attacks?  By friendly
fork, I mean a fork on github where I beg you to pull the changes, and
which goes away if you do.

Your are welcome to fork Catena. I add you as a Collaborator. So feel
free to add an optimized version of Catena.


Best regards,
Christian
