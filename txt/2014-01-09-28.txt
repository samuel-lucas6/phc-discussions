Do you really want to allocate 1GB of RAM on a tablet or smartphone to
perform the login process? A lot of those devices have less then
1GB of RAM. In general I'm not convinced that a significant amount of
useres/admins are not pleased with a login process that
allocates a huge amount of the systems RAM. On many host, such a
solution will virtually enforce swapping. Just saying. :-)

What sort of size of memory requirement does one actually need to impose to
cause difficulty for i. GPUs, ii. FPGA/ASICs?
