We know that, but they don't, no matter how big we write it on the web
site/final specification/media announcement.  If we don't set KDF-style
requirements then at some point someone is going to run the PHC-winner's
output through Dieharder and announce on Slashdot/a conference paper/front
page of the NY Times that the PHC chose a flawed algorithm, and no amount
of
trying to explain the difference between a KDF and a PHC will overcome
that.
So it had better act as a KDF, whether that was an original design goal or
not.

Agree with this 100%. There is already more than enough confusion about
what algorithms to use, and how. "Experts" will come in suggesting "using
proven algorithms such as SHA-256", and we'll be back to square one.

It's also not inconceivable that people will actually use the winner as a
KDF. I've personally seen bcrypt be used that way more than once, even
though "it is just a password scrambler."

(Nevermind that it would actually be good to have an even stronger KDF
rather than just a password scrambler, as long as it is extremely easy for
people to use the password scrambler component, i.e. as easy or easier than
bcrypt.)

"You can use PBKDF2 and scrypt for password authentication, so why
shouldn't you be able to use bcrypt and <PHSto derive keys?"
