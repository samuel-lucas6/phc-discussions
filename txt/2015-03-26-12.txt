I agree.  My favorite ASIC defense scheme is running Makwa boxes while
doing useful proof-of-work for securing a block chain at the same time.
People wonder what we could do with all that wasted BitCoin computation.
My favorite answer is that we could do Makwa password strengthening.  I
originally thought the ASIC boxes could do either block-chain computations
or Makwa password strengthening, but not both at the same time.  I recently
realized that we can use the actual password strengthening computations to
also secure the block chain.  Add to that the potential of securing
identity public keys in the block chain, and we can do authentication
globally, with very little MITM risk, free from the current CA mess.
