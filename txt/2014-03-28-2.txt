Sure, but then pufferfish would be similar to escrypt and TwoCats.

And that would be bad?  :-D

I intend to work on something like this much later, way after the PHC
submission deadline.  I think things like that - additional
implementations of portions of the functionality - can be added later,
including as far as PHC is concerned.  I've got better uses for the
remaining time before the submission deadline.

Just in case my opinion matters, I think that's totally a "tweak", and
not a rewrite at all.  I look forward to seeing it.

I had the same thought that doing the two block-size thing would make
PufferFish like Escrypt and TwoCats.  Not doing it seems like a
critical limitation.  PufferFish is cool.  I think it would be cooler
with one more outer loop, though it threatens the simplicity that I
like about it.
