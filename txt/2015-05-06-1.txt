      So the pseudo-entropy for H1 is 3.32 bit larger than the pseudo-entropy for H2,
      not 6.64.

Sorry, your math is still wrong.  Mallory gets a 100X benefit.

My math is correct. But I see what you mean. Increasing the memory by a 
factor of ten on the defender's machine, at the same speed, can actually 
increase Malory's costs by more than a factor of ten, depending on 
Mallory's hardware.
