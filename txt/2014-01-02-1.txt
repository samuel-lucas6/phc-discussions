I've done some hand optimization, and gotten the speed to be only about
2.2X slower than memmove when copying 2GB over itself.  To get the speed, I
stopped reading randomly from the "from page", and read it linearly
instead.  This seemed to help the optimizer quite a bit, and the output
still seems somewhat (but not perfectly) random according to dieharder
tests.  This is my 3GHz Core i7 machine.  keystretch on 2GB is taking .433
seconds while a memmove takes .2s.

Running multiple copies of memmove shows my system seems to handle about
23GB/s of memory bandwidth.  Two copies of keystretch achieve about 13GB/s.
 It's not maxing out memory bandwidth, but it's getting there...
