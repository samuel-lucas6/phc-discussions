Subject: Re: [PHC] Argon2 v1.0 versus v1.2

Our current intention is to wait for the updates proposed/requested by the panel and to integrate those with Argon2 v1.2 

Thus neither v1.0 nor v1.2 is the final version, but v1.2 is closer to it and whatever security analysis you are going to make probably should target v1.2 first. 

Best regards,
The Argon team

Version 1.0 was the PHC winner, so I am tempted to spend my time looking at v1.0. At the same time, if v1.2 is the version that the world will use (assuming that the world starts using Argon2) I should probably focus on v1.2.

Argon2 v1.2 was announced on June 22 on this list, but appears to not have been archived. The announced modifications
were presented as an optional update to be considered post-PHC (i.e., now). Below I quote the announcement by Dmitry
Khovratovich:
