I doubt that you really need to store <depthof indices. Of course,
this depends on an implementation of TMTO, but in a naive one that I
have in mind needs only one stored index per missing block. Suppose
that you store M[0],M[1], M[3],M[4], but M[2] and M[5] are missing
(picture attached). Then instead of M[5] you store the block address
needed to recompute M[5], i.e. \phi(5) = 2 (in this example). You look
up for M[2], it is missing too, so you go for M[0] and retrieve it.

You're right.  I think I got confused by my sim-tmto.c sometimes needing
to store multiple indices per block, but that's because it is dealing
with potentially multiple overwrites - that's not the same as depth in
your report.  So in what I wrote the multiplier shouldn't be depth as in
your report, but rather number of other direct dependency blocks and
previous contents that a not stored block depends on, on average.

Thus I do not understand why the block size is different before and
after TMTO in your calculations...

Oh, it was not that.  Perhaps I was unclear.  The block size stays the
same, but I tried to infer what it should be to meet a certain goal.
