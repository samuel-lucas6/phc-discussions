- If the memory accesses are all password-dependent, then it is
easier to discard guesses even before the memory is filled.
- If the memory accesses are all password-independent, then it is
easier to eliminate memory latencies from the attack costs even with
cheap memory (just prefetch what  you need soon before you use it).

there is a very siginificant difference between leaking a secret and
allowing for some performance optimizations. the former is a break,
the latter is just reducing the security margin by some. if we don't
have the proper security margin, having an extra 50% cost won't change
much. actually even doubling the cost is equivalent of only 1 bit
password strength. you maybe educating the user to have one more
character in the password does more for us than a tight cost
requirement.

also we need to bear in mind that defender can optimize as well,
especially in case of simple access patterns. a simple pre-reading of
the values in time will give you that, with some added complexity. i
was actually thinking about doing that, but discarded the idea for
simplicity.
