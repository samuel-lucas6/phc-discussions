I appreciate this feedback on my TwoCats algorithm.  I agree TwoCat's
design is less well understood/tested with it's single-pass architecture
than the multi-pass architectures, which inherit more from Scrypt.  There
are other poorly understood aspects as well.

I look forward to the final winner(s) selection.  There are a lot of us out
there who are looking forward to the next generation of password
protection, and frankly, the state of the art is already moving ahead due
to the fine work done here.

Bill
