Thanks for taking part in this discussion.  The attack with 1/e memory was
pretty awesome!  I never looked at cases where t_cost 1.

While your algorithm is cool, and showed a weakness in Argon2i, I still
think your algorithm is too slow.  How fast can you fill memory?
Memory*time defense goes as the square of this number.  Some good
algorithms fill 4MiB in 1ms.
