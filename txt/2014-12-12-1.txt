Subject: How important is salting really?

Password security researchers learn more and more from data breaches seemingly every week. Dictionaries and candidate generation algorithms get better all the time. So here's a question. Maybe the answer has changed over the last few years and we should revisit our assumptions.

Two different people independently choose this same password. It could be "ilovecats" or it could be something less obvious.

What is the probability that this password will not be in attackers' dictionaries or it will be hard to crack?

(If this chance is small, then what do we gain by salting?)
