This takes about 3 minutes to run. With SSE or AVX it will be
faster but this is a nice PoC. Note that the generation only needs
to be done once per m_cost and once for each t_cost when m_cost is
zero.

Wow, you're good! Really good... You considered *this* code too ugly
to post? Generating the XORs and compiling them totally beats the
speed of what I was going to do (compute them on the fly as matrices).
I see that I need to try and be an even more evil attacker :-)

Thanks and this isn't the ugly code I cleaned it up a bit. This was one file and
a lot of commented out code.
