+1.  There's still a surprisingly large developer base using VC++ 6.0,
particularly freeware/shareware developers, because it was the last non-
bloat/non-license-locked Windows compiler.  Every few years when I ask my
users whether they still need VC++ 6.0 support I get a pile of replies asking
me to keep it.  It's not only small-scale users either, as recently as a few
months ago I had to do some remote debugging with developers at a
multinational corporation (market cap in the tens of billions) and the
compiler I ended up screen-sharing with them was VC++ 6.0.
