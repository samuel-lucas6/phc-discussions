Subject: Current PHC temperature

I remember talking to Joan Daemen at Passwords12 in Oslo, just after
Jens Steube (atom, author of hashcat) did his presentation on the SHA-1
weakness (or optimization, as many of you would call it).

His words were in the area of "it is so simple, so elegant. We
cryptographers like that."

I don't mind good discussions with a high temperature about the topic at
hand, but please, do hold back on the personal accusations, and drop the
legal/crime debate.

Anonymous voting imho is good, so we lower the risk of personal
accusations and pointy fingers. I wouldn't mind seeing the anonymized
versions of the NOT ADVANCE descriptions from the panelists. As a minimum.

I would like to have one (or more) winner(s) presenting at PasswordsCon
in Las Vegas in august if possible, or at PasswordsCon somewhere in
europe in december. Hopefully a fair competition will end with a fair
result.

Best regards,
Per
