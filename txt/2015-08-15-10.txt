By the way, applying this to an Edwards curve, I just proved that the
addition law when d == -1 for the x coordinate can be restated:

    x3 = JacobiSN[EllipticF[ArcSin[x1], -1] + EllipticF[ArcSin[x2], -1], -1]

The regular rule is:

    x3 = (x1*y2 + x2*y1)/(1 - x1*y1*x2*y2)

where

    y = sqrt((x^4 + 1)/(x^2 + 1))

Now, I don't yet know what the JacobiSN function is, but that's something
I'll read about :)  However, the ArcSin function, AFAIK, can not be
computed using modular arithmetic.  However, the overall function is very
efficient with modular arithmetic.  This is all easier to see with circle
based groups.
