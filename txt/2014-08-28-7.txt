If so, why not for lower sizes as well?  Do you mention this as the
lower boundary just in case, since Pufferfish (and bcrypt, but it's not
in PHC) might win at some really low sizes (perhaps way below 1 MiB)?

Lyra2 is a close
second, off by about 2X in my tests, only because Lyra2 does not have
a multi-threading option.

Only 2x worse while completely lacking computation latency hardening?
Are you sure it's safe to rely solely on memory latency and bandwidth?
Previously, you were not so sure.

Here's two sets of cache tests.

Thanks!  Per these results, for 4096 byte blocks all 3 levels of cache
are equally fast, and RAM is less than 2x slower.  This may be so for 1
thread on an otherwise idle system, but it is important to remember that
with multiple running threads things may be very different: the caches
closer to the CPU cores may demonstrate much better scalability than
others (and than RAM) since they and/or the buses to them are more
numerous.

(With multi-threaded hashing, with some working set sizes close to the
total L3 cache size, L3 turns out to be moderately slower than RAM.
This is despite of L3 being several times faster than RAM for purely
sequential reads, as opposed to for reads in large random blocks, also
from multiple threads on the same system.  Luckily, this phenomenon, or
rather it occurring to a sufficient extent that L3 appears slower than
RAM, is not very common.)
