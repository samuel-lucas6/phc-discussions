Subject: Please port Argon2 to C

I would prefer for the Argon2 team to do this, but obviously anyone can.
I'm OK with the final official version being the slightly cleaner C++
version, but most existing projects out there that need Argon2 are still
written in C or in a language that expects to link to C libraries.

Thanks,
Bill
