Subject: Re: [PHC] CJK character sets

I wrote a research paper with Rubin Xu on this topic last year using some
leaked datasets of Chinese and Hebrew speaking users:
http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/BX12-W2SP-passwords_character_encoding.pdf

There are many tidbits in there for those interested but the main point, as
suspected by Rich, is that very few Chinese speakers use any non-ASCII
characters in their passwords (and they do use decimal digits much more
frequently). Most of these users now use a Pinyin input system with
graphicl feedback for disambiguation which is disabled for password fields
to prevent shoulder-surfing, so inputting these characters would require
pasting characters from another text field.

It seems that Chinese users don't produce a stronger distribution of
passwords, though we could use more evidence. In any case there shouldn't
be significant implications for the PHC; any candidate should handle
arbitrary binary input and therefore any string of UTF-8.

Cheers,

Joe

remembering 8 idiograms is identical to remembering 8 words. it is
perfectly doable, although most people just does not want to do it. an
english word typically has the entropy of around 11-12 bits,
which is identical to 2000-4000 idiograms. it is not a surprise, words
are words, some languages has a little more, some a little less, but
not that much different.

typing idiograms requires 2-3 button presses, and that is a great
advantage over typing the entire word. but with the caveat that most
interfaces help with the options, so you don't have to remember the
combinations. this is of course unacceptable with passwords.

so i would say, chinese are not at an advantage, even if the system is

but it points into the direction, which i think is right, of using
random words as passwords, and possibly having a system to shorten
them to save typing. it is more human than remembering characters. (i

I would expect that it would make it easier to create and remember
strong entropy. A short 8-character  password in a Western script
could perhaps be more like a pass phrase in Chinese-based script.
