Simplifies password hashing with SHA3 sponge construction

which i don't fully understand, but for sure it is not precise,
because gambit doesn't use SHA3. SHA3 is in the draft, but most likely
it will contain 4 SHA variants, and 2 SHAKEs, but none of those match
the capacity/padding choice in gambit document/sample source, and none
of those allow duplexing, which is a necessity. rather, gambit shares
crypto core (keccak) with SHAs and SHAKEs. thus i would use keccak in
the cited sentence (but i still don't understand it).
