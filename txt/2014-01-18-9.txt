 Similarly,
the idea of the defender using GPUs will not be reasonable in most
instances either.  Yes, there are specific cases where it might be useful
but one needs to address far more mundane scenarios like busy web-servers
on current hardware.

Ok, what would you consider reasonable "general use" parameters for a busy
web-service hosted on reasonable hardware that meets your idea of a minimum
security threshold: how much memory do you intend to use, how much
computation time/cycles do you suggest?

(yes, I'm being cheeky, there is going to be a follow up)
