For non-trivial algorithms, good pseudo-code is not any easier to produce
than a machine-readable implementation.

how about trivial algorithms? btw any algorithm is easier to write in
pseudocode, especially compared to low level languages like c. i don't
think there is a real debate about writing pseudocode is significantly
less error prone than writing actual code. it is pretty much the
rationale behind using them.

they are also easier to read.

It's sort of OK if initial PHC submissions
have bugs;

so what good a buggy reference implementation is? what is the added
value?
