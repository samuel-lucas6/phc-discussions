You have 1200 people *logging in* per second on 4 servers?

Oops, I was looking at the wrong stat, the peak is only about 400 (today, it grows over time). It's not a classic login (like at a bank say), it's lighter weight, but it does require an authentication, so a password hash. And the servers don't have 400G either.
