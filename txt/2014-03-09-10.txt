PBKDF2: Inherits HMAC collisions

HMAC itself isn't the problem. PBKDF2 doesn't inherit an issue from
HMAC, it creates an issue with HMAC.

Collisions only occur when using the password as the key and the salt as
the message. Using the salt as the key and the password as the message
resolves this issue. Generate salts that are the exactly $blocksize in
length, and you don't have to worry about null padding issues, either.
