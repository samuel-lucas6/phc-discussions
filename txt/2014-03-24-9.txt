Depending on the m_cost, doing so could break the memory hardness. Since
only one s-box would be needed at a time, the attacker could hold each
s-box in global memory and swap them into local memory when they are
needed. Using each s-box simultaneously prevents this from occuring.

You are right. And I think using the s-boxes simultaneously would not be
an easy solution as I expected.
But I agree to Bill, that increasing the memory cost of Pufferfish would
achieve more confidence, even if it is much less than other memory-hard
schemes. The authors of bcrypt thought (1999) of 14 KB as a „moderate“
memory amount. Maybe in this time „moderate“ means something like 1 MB.
I like Bcrypt and I would be glad if we could extend this algorithm for
the current requirements. Good luck, Jeremi!
