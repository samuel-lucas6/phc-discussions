Oops, not quite what I meant to say there, but I'm sure you got the idea ;)

To clarify: you would pass in the hash/salt "on file" along with the
alleged password, and the function would return whether or not the provided
password matches the supplied hash/salt. The arguments are, otherwise, the
same as the hashing function.

As an API strawman, if this is our hashing function:

    PHS(out, outlen, in, inlen, salt, saltlen, t_cost, m_cost)

we might consider:

   PHS_VERIFY(hash, hashlen, in, inlen, salt, saltlen, t_cost, m_cost)

(I'm not particularly married to the name "PHS_VERIFY", so please bikeshed
away ;)
