Oh yes I do want that.

I emphatically concur.

One of the goals of this whole project is to be able to
provide a simple recommendation to developers that do
not depend on the developer understanding things like salt.

Remember that “developer” covers the range of people
developing cryptographic systems to people coding up website
login pages in PHP.


It is part of the deal. A simple-to-use API that
minimizes risks of misuse would offer two functions: one for generating
the hash _and_ the salt.

Such an API can be implemented more or less generically around a core
single-call API that expects the salt as parameter and outputs raw
binary. However, I think it is important that such an API is provided
along with the "reference" implementation, because being tagged
"reference" will lower the probability that other people reinvent it
poorly.

The difficulty is that the reference implementation should be as
portable as possible, but calls to a CSPRNG are system dependent.
