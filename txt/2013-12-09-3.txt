for use in attacking other sites/services.

The core idea behind this submission is that it may be worth giving up the
security in use case 1, as well as making it possible for an attacker to
log into a site via a collision, with the end goal of making use case 2
more costly for an attacker. Or to put it another way, there's a lot of
sites on the internet that are not valuable to users, but are valuable to
attackers looking to steal credentials for use in attacking more valuable
sites.

I'm inclined to like this idea, but three objections are always raised,
and never seem to be resolved:

1. Game theory: A rational website would not decrease its own security
to make the user's account on other websites (business competitors) more
secure.

2. "Experienced" users cannot choose their own level of security. They
are forced to have their security downgraded because other users are
re-using passwords on other websites when they are not. They're using a
64-character random ASCII password but someone could still log in to
their account after a million online requests. This almost punishes good
user behavior.

3. Rate limiting and account lockout across the Internet is hard.

You can't just sleep(5000) before each authentication request, because
requests can be made in parallel. You can't rate limit based on the
source address, since it's easy to get tons of IPs (botnets, IPv6). You
can rate limit based on the account, but this makes it easier to DoS a
specific user and doesn't stop attackers from sending parallel requests
to many *different* accounts.

If hashes are 20 bits, and the attacker has 2^20 IP addresses, I don't
see how you could reasonably prevent them from getting into at least one
account without knowing the real password.

I am very interested to see if you've solved any of these problems.

This idea was also discussed after I proposed it to the GRC newsgroups
in 2011, there might be something useful there:
