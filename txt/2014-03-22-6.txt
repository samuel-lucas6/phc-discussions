so far, i have heard only one reason for offline cost upgrade, and it
is the problem of abandoned passwords. however, for that problem, we
have the obvious solution of simply deleting old passwords.

For the weak password problem, we have the obvious solution of
simply using strong password. SCNR! :-)

Companies usually do not delete user/costumer accounts/records/files
since they rate those data as mission critical.

BTW I fully agree with your position. Inactive users should be disabled.
