Subject: Re: [PHC] PolyPassHash is broken

I agree with your point, if _admins_ choose very weak passwords (<32 bits
of entropy).  However, if admins are choosing passwords with very low
entropy, then brute force over the network is also a big risk though.

Will any hashing scheme protect an admin account that chooses 'password' or
'abc123' as their password?  (At least PPH protects thresholdless accounts
even with these horrid passwords.)

Making admins choose passwords that aren't completely broken seems to be a
viable task.  Many organization already try to require this for all users
by requiring some numbers / letters / min length, etc.

As always, the feedback / discussion is appreciated...
Justin

Sure you can do this.  Once a threshold is reached, the attack will
be detected because the full password hashes will not match.  That
is, unless the attacker is fortunate enough so that the partial
hash collision is the actual full hash / password.

I have to agree with Steve that the Partial Validation feature needs
work.  I was convinced the scheme proposed in the paper was secure
until I read that section, which puts security in doubt.

Revealing even two bytes of the password hash is dangerous.  For
example, if there are 4 administrators, and two of them have passwords
with only 32 bits of entropy, meaning that they exist in my 4-billion
entry dictionary, and if only 2 shares are needed, then without the
Partial Verification feature, I still have to try up to 2^64 guesses
to find the master key, once I've chosen the right two admin accounts.
However, with 16 bits of the hash from two password hashes, in 4*2^32
hashes I can easily build dictionaries for all of them containing only
matching hashes, which would be about 2^16 each.  I then only need to
try 2^32 combinations for each of the 4 possible pairs to find the
key.  Essentially, what this does is make it just about as easy to
attack the database as if PolyPassHash were not in use.

In general, I think most admins always want to be able to log in.
This is a significant problem for wide-spread adoption of
PolyPassHash, without the Partial Verification feature.  However, this
seems to need work.
