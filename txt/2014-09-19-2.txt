If the memory access pattern depends on the salt, it is still known at the
time of computation so that the necessary data can still be prefetched from
the memory.

On the bus home today, I realized something - I've seen a number of

deeply-pipelined/prefetching attackers) vs. no-secret-data-dependent-access
(foil timing attacks), and I think they may both be satisfiable.

The idea is that by executing a compute-hard function over the salt-derived
lookup data at each step, we can further bound attackers. In fact, my PoC
basically treats the salt the same as the password, except that it's also
used to decide what to access (and as a seed for the memory-filling stage).
