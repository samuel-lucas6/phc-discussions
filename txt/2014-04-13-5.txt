I think these aren't exactly in the same category.

Pufferfish tries to improve upon bcrypt by deviating from Blowfish
proper as core of this bcrypt-inspired scheme.  With this, it goes
64-bit and beyond 4 KiB.

battcrypt focuses on bringing bcrypt-like GPU resistance, staying at
32-bit and 4 KiB for that, to scripting languages, etc. that provide
Blowfish (but not bcrypt) as a native code primitive.  (Implementing
bcrypt in those languages would be too inefficient, killing the anti-GPU
advantage it otherwise has over e.g. something based on SHA-512, because
bcrypt doesn't build solely on top of a full Blowfish implementation.)
battcrypt also goes beyond 4 KiB for its total memory cost, with a
separate layer (unlike Pufferfish, which has only one layer).

In other words, Pufferfish is primarily for native code implementations,
and battcrypt is primarily for scripting languages with native Blowfish.

Jeremi, Steve - are the above correct summaries?
