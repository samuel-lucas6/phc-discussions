How about Argon2sdi?

-(separates the salt from password 
processing)
-pass0: independent ram-fill or expand
-pass1: catena3-saltmix-inspired salt-
dependent addressing  to perform random 
swaps ala RC4 (swapping only a half of the 
state seems sufficient)
-pass2: independent mix to prevent pass1 
being undone

It should be faster than Argon2i, unified 
hybrid like Lyra2, sophisticated like Catena, 
etc.
