Ok, this is all really unfair.

I don't see anything unfair in any of the tests described so far.
They're just some of the tests we can run.

Of course we should attack X exactly
as you say.  I think I should skip attacking H(X) (without PRK).  An
author with a weak X has work to do.

OK.

Now I'm not going to be able to sleep for another week!

Sorry about that!  But you didn't have to volunteer for this job. ;-)

Aren't we supposed to shooting the s*, and
talk about integrating FPGA programmability into multi-CPU thingies at

(Bill is referring to a topic I had raised off-list, suggesting that we
