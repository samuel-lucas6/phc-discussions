The hashing scheme has to be specifically
designed such that "as long as the salts are not known/predictable by
the attacker", it is immune to side-channel attacks.  And ideally this
should be easy to see.  I think in (ye)scrypt it is easy to see (even
though in scrypt this probably wasn't a deliberate design goal).

and since there is no 100% side channel proof algorithm, we should
demand this property from all hashes.

submission version gambit was not protected. current version is, since
i implemented the crypto module approach. and i just now recalled that
the lecture that inspired me to do that is exactly about this.
