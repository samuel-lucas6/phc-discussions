Sorry... off by 1000X here.  Make that $8.50/day per ASIC you have 
selling max hashes full-bore.  Maybe 10 of these things in a box?

Ok, this is why people have trouble asking me for advice about
security.  If I could reliably multiply decimal numbers, then maybe...

At 0.01 cents per hash, and our low-end ASIC doing 1,000 1-second
hashes per second of 1,000,000 squarings, it makes ten cents per
second.  That's actually $8,600 per day, like I said the first time.

I'm having to do this while my wife explains something about
"infomercial about stand up to cancer"...  and the "Draft Day" is
available, and who the heck is Jennifer Gardner?  Still trying to
check my math... freaking impossible...

In my defense, when I failed to multiply both times, I had children
screaming in my ear, and right now a cat is trying to tear my flesh
off.  Plus, I never was any good at arithmetic.

The freaking cat just bit me again!  And something from my wife about
"Vampire Academy"... there's something to be said for going to work
instead of working from home :-D

I can't review this email because of the constant stream of words
comming in from 3 directions... The Water Boy, Heaven Can Wait, Semi
Tough... forget it.

I give up!  Seriously... this is what I'm dealing with writing this email.
