I think it'd be pretty cool if that happened!

I agree.  One thing I haven't figured out is how to do Blakerypt style
session key protection with server relief.  A Blakerypt session key is
a secret associated with the password which is decrypted with a secret
master key on the server.  So long as it remains a secret, off-line
brute-force attacks become impractical.  It's an awesome extra level
of protection for servers that implement it.  The problem is how can
we keep the session key secret if we broadcast it to clients?  I
suspect this is solvable...
