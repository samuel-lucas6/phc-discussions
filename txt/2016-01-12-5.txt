Subject: Re: [PHC] Re: Attack on Argon2i?

I confirmed what the paper said with a small test program you can get from
github <https://github.com/waywardgeek/argon2memtest>.  Here's the output
when run using 2^26 1KiB blocks:

./argon2memtest $((1 << 26))
Max blocks used 12409040 out of 67108864.  Memory reduction 5.41X

So, the memory reduction without recomputations is actually closer to
5.41X, in single-pass mode.  While higher than I was expecting, the
recommended minimum t_cost for Argon2i is 3, and should remain 3.  I
personally would generally use Argon2i with t_cost of 3, while Argon2id
with t_cost of 1.
