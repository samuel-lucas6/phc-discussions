Why would it need to if it knew the userid fm the login fields?  Perhaps we are talking abut two different problems?

I was thinking the kitten processors would be working on new dictionaries and adding the domain to the hash which would be a good way to cause the attacker to have to generate a fresh set of dictionaries for each site.  Fine, but if you add userid (converted to lower/upper case to avoid server mismatches) to the hash they would need a dictionary for each user at that site.  ...or at a minimum, they would have to discover the userid for the victim.

Are you thinking of a different use case?

Yes.  I'm thinking that the kitten site would only be able to compute
hashes with domain = "kittens.com" (or maybe "anything.kittens.com")
and not, say, "whitehouse.gov".
