i thank you for that method for two reasons.

reason 1: it is neat and simple, does not branch on secret, and a nice concept overall.

reason 2: the math used for the proof is the exact same math i need to analyise my earlier proposal. i can't believe that i might be able to actually come up with a proof on my own, based on this. that said, if someone is willing to help me out, drop be a mail.

bonus reason: i used the same bit-reversal in my first attempt, but then opted for a simpler go-backwards pattern.
