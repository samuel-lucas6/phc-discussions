And now for the other "salt table". For those that don't see the need for this,
it's because you probably haven't ran into a scheme that has lots of salt
collisions: crypt(3) (12 bit salt
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Traditional_DES-based_scheme) or
vBulletin (3 character salt). These cause massive amounts of salt collisions and
as such you have a table of unique salts "salt table". You run through the salt
table and remove them when they are no longer needed. If salts are large enough
there is little difference between a salt table and a list of all the hashes
with their salts.

Thanks for clearing this up. Since most good password hash functions use salts with at least 128 bits, it is easy to
wonder why indexing by salt would be a good idea.
