Nice.  Here are parameter's I've added to NoelKDF:

num_threads     - the number of threads to run in parallel
parallelism     - number of inner loops allowed to run in parallel - should
match
                  user's machine for best protection
num_hash_rounds - number of SHA256 rounds to compute the intermediate key
clear_in        - when true, overwrite the in buffer with 0's early on

Also, I "borrowed" the excellent Catena idea for "garlic", and use t_cost
in the outer loop, where I double memory each time through the loop.  Users
wont need it, but server admins will like it.  I also have a flag like
yours for clearing and freeing memory.

I have to say that people on this forum have been extremely generous with
their ideas and feedback.  As a crypto noob, I've benefitted tremendously.

Now... as for your chart.  That looks like your telling me the password
length based on the runtime of the hash.  Is this right?  A snooper for
run-time is trivial and runs in user mode.

Bill
