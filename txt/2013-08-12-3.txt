Subject: The EARWORM password hash

The password hash implementation that I alluded to yesterday in my
question about C99 extensions isn't quite ready for release yet, but
this seems like a good time at least to briefly share what I'm working
on, even if only as pseudocode.

EARWORM is a password hash designed to be bound by memory bandwidth.
It is inspired somewhat by Solar Designer's concept of "ROM-port
hardness", and has in common the benefit that it can demand an almost
arbitrarily large amount of (read-only) memory for an almost
arbitrarily small amount of time.  This should make it an appealing
choice for busy web servers that need to process a high volume of
login requests at low latency.

EARWORM has some drawbacks that will likely make it unappealing for
most other use cases. Using EARWORM only makes sense if its ROM is
kept resident in memory most or all of the time, because for most
reasonable choices of time and space parameters, loading the ROM from
disk will take a lot longer than the hash computation itself. Hogging
a big chunk of RAM 24x7 is fine if it's actually in use for most of
that time, but it's an undue burden if you're using it twice a day to
hash your laptop password.

EARWORM is designed to take advantage of Intel AES-NI instructions,
and takes a steep performance hit if they're not available. This makes
it a poor choice for use on mobile devices, or in sandboxed
environments (e.g. web browsers) that do not allow native code
execution.

In spite of these drawbacks, I think EARWORM will fill its chosen
niche more effectively than anything else proposed to date.

Anyway, without further ado, here is a pseudocode description of
EARWORM.

|| denotes concatenation.

The function

  prf(secret,salt,outlen)

is PBKDF2-SHA256-HMAC with an iteration count of 1. outlen is in bytes.

The function

  aesround(block,roundkey)

is the round function for AES encryption. The Intel AESENC instruction
computes precisely this function.

CHUNK_LENGTH, CHUNK_WIDTH, and WORKUNIT_DEPTH are integer constants,
provisionally defined to be 128, 4, and 256 respectively.

The function

  workunit(secret,salt,m_cost,arena,outlen)

takes the following inputs:

  * 'secret' is the password being hashed, considered as an octet
    string of variable length.

  * 'salt' is another octet string of variable length.

  * 'm_cost' is the memory cost parameter.

  * 'arena' is a read-only three-dimensional array of 128-bit words,
    with dimensions (2**m_cost) by CHUNK_LENGTH by CHUNK_WIDTH.

  * 'outlen' is the desired output length.

The arena's entire contents are random, initialized once by the site
administrator and then reuseable indefinitely.

workunit() maintains the following state variables:

  * 'scratchpad' is a one-dimensional array of CHUNK_WIDTH 128-bit words.
  
  * 'index_a' and 'index_b' are integers.

Its body is as follows:

begin workunit(secret,salt,m_cost,arena,outlen)

    index_a || index_b := prf(secret, 0x00 || salt, 32)
    index_a := mod(index_a, 2**m_cost)
    index_b := mod(index_b, 2**m_cost)

    scratchpad[0 .. (CHUNK_WIDTH - 1)] :=
        prf(secret, 0x01 || salt, 16 * CHUNK_WIDTH)
   
    for d from 0 to (WORKUNIT_DEPTH / 2)

        for l from 0 to (CHUNK_LENGTH - 1)
            for w from 0 to (CHUNK_WIDTH - 1)
                scratchpad[w] := aesround(scratchpad[w], arena[index_a][l][w])
            end for
        end for

        index_a := mod(scratchpad[0], 2**m_cost)

        for l from 0 to (CHUNK_LENGTH - 1)
            for w from 0 to (CHUNK_WIDTH - 1)
                scratchpad[w] := aesround(scratchpad[w], arena[index_b][l][w])
            end for
        end for

        index_b := mod(scratchpad[0], 2**m_cost)

    end for

    return prf(scratchpad[0 .. (CHUNK_WIDTH - 1)], 0x02 || salt, outlen)
end workunit

The EARWORM hash function is then computed by calling workunit()
t_cost times with distinct salts, and XORing together the
outputs. (Hence, workunits can be computed in parallel).

The structure of the workunit function provides opportunities for some
nice optimizations.  Presuming that the length/width/depth constants
are known at compile-time, all loops can be unrolled, and all the
function's mutable state (scratchpad, index_a, and index_b) can be
held in registers.  Therefore, the 'l' and 'w' loops can be optimized
down to nothing but a long series of AESENC instructions.  Since
index_a and index_b can be computed right after one 'l' loop but then
are not used until the after the completion of the next one, chunks
of ROM can be prefetched and be warm in L1 cache by the time they're
needed.

Experimentation on my Opteron 6376 workstation shows that computing a
single workunit takes about 350 microseconds, and that two CPU cores
are sufficient to saturate my memory bandwidth (PC3-12800 ECC,
quad-channel).
