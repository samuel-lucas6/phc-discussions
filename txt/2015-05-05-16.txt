1) For legitimate users, part of the PHS's computation time would be
wasted calculating the indices to be visited, while attackers could do
so only once and reuse the pre-computed indices in many threads,
diluting the corresponding costs. To avoid giving more advantage to
attackers than to legitimate users, the computation of indices should be
as lightweight as possible (which is a goal in Catena and also in
Lyra2's first pass).

In Argon2i the indices are produced in groups. 256 indices cost as
much as filling 2 memory blocks.
Therefore, the overhead is less than 1%.

2) Some salts/parameters will end up leading to weaker visitation
patterns than others. This is unlikely to be critical in the long run,
but that would be similar to having "weak keys" in cryptographic
algorithms. So, if those are avoidable, it would probably be better.

In Argon2i indices depend on the block number only, not on the salt.
