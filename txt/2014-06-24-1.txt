Steve, I guess you're already aware of this, but in case not: we're also
going to have this instruction in AVX-512, it's called
VPTERNLOGD/VPTERNLOGQ there.  I learned about it from Samuel Neves in
February.  I also found this table now:

Might as well take this chance to make this public, someone may find it useful: https://github.com/sneves/avx512-utils

This is a small header file that can be used to compute VPTERNLOG immediates at compile time, via an expression that
resembles normal code (see example). It requires a modern C++11 compiler; coincidentally, most compilers that support
AVX-512F at this point also support C++11 (Intel 14.0.1+ and GCC 4.9+; Clang supports AVX-512, but does not seem to have
the intrinsics yet). You can see the resulting assembly code of  the example here: http://goo.gl/mrDjbd
