Hi,

It's finally released:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2018/03/09/1

The core design of yescrypt is unchanged since its last revision
submitted to PHC in 2015.  Even the test vectors used in PHC have
remained the same.  It's the various extras (beyond the PHC-mandated
functionality) that took extra time to finalize and that have changed.

The announcement linked above provides a lot more detail on this.

Alexander
