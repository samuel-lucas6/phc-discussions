I would also like to say that our next PasswordsCon event will be at
NTNU university in Trondheim, Norway, on December 8-9 (monday-tuesday).

For the first time we plan on doing our standard presentations for one
day, and academic proceedings to be published for our second day. This
should hopefully attract more academic researchers to attend, while
improving our goal of mixing research with security professionals from
around the world.

We are currently working out our CFP (Presentations & Papers), hopefully
to appear during the next couple of days, and a review board is being
assembled as well.

More info to appear soon.
