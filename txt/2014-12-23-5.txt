To exhaust 62^8 keyspace with this

PUE in 2014 is 1.7 so actual electricity cost would be more like $3684.48.

And that's just for a single hash. For 400k salts (which is what Sc00bz
estimated in the comments) the effective rate with 16x 290X would only
be about 63 H/s.

Awesome. I'm guessing you have the info to estimate the breakup between
on-dictionary, near-dictionary (candidate gen), and random passwords? Any
chance you can do some guesstimates on the other two categories for
completeness.

I guess at 63 H/s you can cover the top 20K passwords in 5 and a half
minutes (for a cost of about 28c compared to the $3684.48). And hit 2^28
candidates in the same time/cost as the above example (for all the hashes
instead of just 1).
