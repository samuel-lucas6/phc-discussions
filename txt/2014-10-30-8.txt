Hi Jakob,

interesting paper and survey!

I would note that both definitions 1 and 2 are ambiguous in what can be
considered an efficient function or adversary. If you make Def 1 more
rigorous by specifying a constant Q such that O(f(x)) < O(PS(x))/Q, then
the definition seems to implicitly require to discard/overwrite/nullify the
first 1/Q outputs of the internal compression function/block generator. For
one-pass schemes this is equivalent to the total memory reduction by the
fraction of (1-1/Q), whereas all two-pass schemes seem to satisfy this
constraint.

Even that reduction seems to be relevant to schemes with data-dependent
addressing only, because the schemes with data-independent addressing
either have two passes or more, or badly suffer from tradeoff attacks (it
is easy to show reduction in the time-area product for (virtually) all
one-pass data-independent schemes).

Best regards,
Dmitry

It focuses on comparing general and security properties. Moreover, it
formally introduces the two attack types garbage-collector attacks and
weak garbage-collector attacks. For each candidate, we argue why it
provides resistance against these attack types or we actually show an
attack.
