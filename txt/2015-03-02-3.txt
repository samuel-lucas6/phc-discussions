Subject: Comparing speed of entries

There seems to be some confusion about how to compare the speed of entries
in the PHC.  IMO, we should:

- Compare entries when using the _same_ hash function, the same number of
rounds, and the same number of threads.

With this simple rule, it is easy to see that Yescrypt is the fastest,
Lyra2 is the second fastest.

Speed counts :-)
