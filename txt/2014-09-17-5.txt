I think it would be very difficult to make use of the runtime to guess
who had just authenticated.  However, Krisztian is right that this is
a timing leak, though as he said, it may be a minor one.

All three of these algorithms are at more risk of leaking information
in cache-timing, I think.  Going full timing-attack resistant is one
extreme worth exploring.  I think massive data-dependent branching and
addressing is the other, and also worth exploring.

The running time will be different, but the question is how you are
going to exploit it without full hashing. Suppose you have the time
information, then you do only partial hashing and look at the
running time of this part. Both running times should have normal
distribution, so you might be able to calculate your advantage in
terms of false positive and false negative rates. However, to win
even a factor of two, your distributions should have very large
sigma, which is doubtful if you have say millions of branches.
