One current unknown is that the split for "allow tweaks" is just "now"

candidates can get tweaks in in a few weeks or a few months.  Would it
help to have a time estimate by the various people involved for how
long it'd take to get the tweaks ready?

For what it's worth, and (perhaps unwisely) presuming that Makwa is still
one of the "leading candidates", I hereby declare that I do not intend to
publish any tweak to Makwa in the near or far future.

I am working on an OpenCL implementation, though, in order to get some
actual data on GPU speed when it comes to doing lots of modular
squarings. I hope to have some figures within a fortnight or so.
