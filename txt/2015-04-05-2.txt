Hi,

I've recently updated the wiki page on yescrypt for v1, and I've just
added some pseudocode illustrating a typical yescrypt invocation - that
way, it actually looks quite simple:

https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/yescrypt

I tried to keep the pseudocode notation similar to what's already used
on the wiki for other candidates.

While at it, I noticed that these wiki pages have broken download links
(not updated to current versions, so giving 404):

https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/argon
https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/catena
https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/lyra2
https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/parallel
https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/pomelo
https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/pufferfish

These are missing pseudocode:

https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/parallel
https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/pomelo
https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/pufferfish

The pseudocode for Parallel should be particularly easy to add.  Steve?

That's for finalists only.  Perhaps there are similar issues with many
non-finalist wiki pages as well.
