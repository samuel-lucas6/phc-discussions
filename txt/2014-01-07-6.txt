Actually, looking at Lyra.c, it seems they are already aware of the
competition:

int PHS(void *out, size_t outlen, const void *in, size_t inlen, const
void *salt, size_t saltlen, unsigned int t_cost, unsigned int m_cost){
    return lyra(in, inlen, salt, saltlen, t_cost, 64, m_cost, outlen, out);
}
