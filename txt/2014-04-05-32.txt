Obviously, I'm all for mechanical tests.  In case it makes it easier
for everyone, I just created a git repo on github for mechanical

I just realised how dumb it is to start with my own repo, rather than
a fork of Poul-Henning Kamp's.  I just forked his PHC repo.  I plan to
do only very minor edits in "master", which I can then use to submit
pull requests.  I'm creating a "testing" branch where I'll do all my
mechanical testing.  Any collaborators would be welcome.
