moore's law says 3% increase per month, 20% in half year. if our 
security margin is so low we can't afford that, we are screwed
anyway, and it is time to ditch password based identification.

i agree that security is effectively nonexistent. but improving it
is another story. launch the PRPC. as far as usability goes, i see
no problem resetting a password after a year. i do it for some
sites 3-4 times a year, minor annoyance. maybe i just got used to
it.

Password policies are usually written by paranoid computer security
engineers, and they are almost never implemented as in writing, due to
constraints and sysadmins.

The same applies to most of the ecosystem around account registration
& password resets.

There are people out there researching & doing some really interesting
work into improving password resets now. The https link via
unencrypted email is easily accessible by many more than your favorite
.gov agency, and doing it over SMS instead doesn't really raise the
bar much for falling victim to a targeted attack.

All that, in combination with 2FA too often being a usability bolt-on
disguising as better security imho deserves a FSCK.

I have hopes for #passwords15 in Las Vegas (August) to perhaps shed
some additional light on these topics, and next iteration after that
will probably December 7-9 at the university in Cambridge, UK.

CFP submissions most welcome.

Best regards,
Per Thorsheim
