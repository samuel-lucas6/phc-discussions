Jeremi, Steve - are the above correct summaries?

Yep, I'd say that is an accurate summation.

Great.  Now, a way battcrypt might win over Pufferfish anyway is if we
determine that it performs better even when both are compiled to native
code (defensive).  This will take some testing, for both defense and
attack.  Are you doing this sort of testing? :-)
