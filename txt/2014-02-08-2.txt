As an option, you might want to reuse the operations and the constant
used in Mersenne twister's initialization:

#define NEXT_STATE(x, i) \
	(x) = 1812433253U * ((x) ^ ((x) >30)) + (i);

where "x" is the current state (32-bit) and "i" is the iteration number.

There's a lot of additional info here:

http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html

including 64-bit and SIMD twisters (not just implementations of the
32-bit MT19937).

Also, see init_by_array() in:

http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/CODES/mt19937ar.c
http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/VERSIONS/C-LANG/mt19937-64.c

This function uses different constants, and has an init_key[] input -
this might fit your needs better.
