I owe you an apology.  I'm sorry to have called your paper and code
weak.  By the paper, I only meant the PHC submission, not your
attached paper.  The code *is* weak as a framework for a secure
successor of Scrypt or bcrypt.  As a demonstration of using the stir,
revolve, and evolve functions for memory hashing, it's buggy, but
likely shows your intent well.  It would be simple enough to cut these
three functions out of Schvrch and paste them into one of the other
entries with a stronger password defense framework.  I'd be happy to
help with that if needed.

Bill
