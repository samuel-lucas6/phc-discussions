I doubt it.

Roughly how many CPUs did you see added to the network (by hashrate)?

IIRC, those hashrate bumps were moderate in absolute terms,
corresponding to a small network someone might be a sysadmin of, or to
use of an affordable number of large Amazon EC2 instances at spot
pricing.  It'd be surprising _not_ to see anyone try these things.

Whenever someone posted enough BitCoins to
make it interesting to have the Yescrypt based coins, suddenly the mining
rate would hugely increase.

I haven't been paying attention, but IIRC the few network hashrate
figures I posted in here corresponded to like 300 quad-core CPUs
(something like 1 MH/s).  Someone with one Amazon EC2 account could have
20 * 24-core instances, and that's like 120 quad-cores.  If two persons
do this, it's 80% of the network hashrate.

And it is quite possible that they actually lost money doing this, like
most people mining cryptocoins probably do (on electricity), yet they
continue anyway.

As soon as those BitCoins were bought, the
mining rate would hugely decrease.  It definitely seemed like someone
controls a huge number of CPUs and can move them around quickly.  I'm not
sure it makes a ton of sense working on generic CPU based systems until
there's some resolution to that.

I agree with you that the botnet maybe-threat is real.  I just doubt
that we've seen it for that one tiny coin yet.
