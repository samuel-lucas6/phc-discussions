Subject: [Netiquette] Quoting

It seems the ancient art of quoting has become lost on some members of
this mailing list.

This is a reminder that, when responding to someone else's email, you
should quote enough of that person's email to let the reader know what
you are responding to. The reader should not have to dig through
previous emails to see what point you are replying to.

Please avoid top-posting and full-quoting; that is, quoting the original
email in its entirety at the bottom of the reply, and typing your reply
at the top of the email. The reader should not have to scroll backwards
and forwards through your email to know what you are replying to. Only
the relevant portions of the original email need to be quoted, and your
response should go below the quoted text. If you are responding to more
than one topic in someone else's email, then quote each of those topics
separately, and put your responses immediately below the associated topic.

Following these simple steps will help ensure the list remains fun and
enjoyable for all.

Sincerely,
The Management
