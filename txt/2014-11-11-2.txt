But it is possible I did something wrong of course...
Well after all it looks like a simple misunderstanding. Catena isn't
supposed to be run with t_cost=lambda=0. In this case only
2*(garlic-min_garlic) calls to blake2b are made. This explains why
there is no difference between BRG and DBG and why your patched Catena
needs more memory.
Not catching this kind of mistake is clearly our fault and we already
uploaded a version with checks to our github repository.

Sincerely
