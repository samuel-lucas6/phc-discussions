Putting fake accounts into database systems has been done for a very long time, certainly longer than the life of any patent.  Not necessarily for reasons related to password security, though.

Not that this matters in the context of the larger message (and concerns) about patents.

"One word of advice: never read a patent. That's right. You'd think that
reading patents to see what they cover is a good idea. It is not. If you
infringe on a patent without having known that you did so, you may end up
paying damages to the patent holder. But if they can prove that you
willfully infringed (because you knew about their patent), you may end up
paying triple damages. So if you read a patent, you automatically increase
your liability for infringing that patent by a factor of three.

[ ... ] I'm also bummed about a patent on
storing fake user accounts with weak passwords in the password
database as a strategy for detecting when the database has been leaked
to brute-force attackers.  This shouldn't impact the PHC, but it's
still a bummer.  It's one of those good ideas that now will be locked
away for 20 years when we need it most.  Software patents are such a
bad idea...
