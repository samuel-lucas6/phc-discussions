Two Cats seems to be taken, but not TwoCats.  Two Cats is a production
company with the same name as a comic book store.  That's about as
clean as you get with names now days.  My daughter thinks Kitten is
probably not taken, or we could use Tiger's full (and embarrassing to
Tiger) name, Tiger Flower.


Tiger Flower is cool.

If you're looking for something cat-themed, perhaps the genus of the
domestic cat, Felis
