i'm not entirely sure that you can do that though. you can certainly
ask the panel to exclude your proposal from the final set. but
otherwise, your algorithm is now out there and available for everyone,
due to your statement in the pdf:

The scheme is and will remain available worldwide on a royalty free
basis

maybe except if you did not have ownership of the algorithm in the
first place?

anyway, i don't know what's going on, but i'm already not liking it.
