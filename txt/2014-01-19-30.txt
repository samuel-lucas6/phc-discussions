This is broken:
* Mem is only read once. So once read you can discard it.

* In the paper you state f=-1 is a perfect choice. Except from i=0 to t/2-1 you
are just reading zeros. So you don't even need the second half of Mem.

* With (C * (t/2) ** (1/2)) ram it will take 2 times longer. C is the size of
the
context of your sponge function. In general this is (C * size ** (1/N)) ram and
N times more computations. Max N is ln(size). I keep hearing about "parallel
cores" I believe it's the same thing or at least similar.
