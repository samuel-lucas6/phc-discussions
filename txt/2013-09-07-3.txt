What about calling them slow hashes?

FWIW, this is what we've been calling them in John the Ripper
development and usage context for a few years now, because we needed to
differentiate "fast" and "slow" hashes (of the hash types that JtR
supports) when talking about program structure, optimizations, usage
instructions (need to bother avoiding occasional duplicate candidate
passwords or not, etc).

A "slow" hash might not include a builtin salting mechanism (although in
practice they almost always do), whereas for PHC this is a requirement.
Yet I am fine with the "slow hashes" term.

That said, in PHC context, we've already started using "PHS", so perhaps
we should stick with that.
