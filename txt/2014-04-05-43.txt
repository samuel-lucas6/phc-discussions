By the way, I would ping the submission list about getting the wrong
version.  Also, I think adding input lengths should be allowed in the
"tweak" period.  So, no biggie.  It looks like you hammered this code
out quick, but it looks like a very serious entry to me.  I'm not a
judge though, nor am I experienced in this field, so my opinions don't
really count much.
