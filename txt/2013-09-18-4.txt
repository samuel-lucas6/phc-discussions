    This would not work as you can simply xor two values together
to remove r. (m0 + r) + (m1 + r) = m0 + m1  

busted

I really don't see the point in all of this. Since if the
attacker is on the authentication box

offline. consider a stolen laptop. not necessarily able to tamper the running system. this IS a different attack model, and makes sense.

I'm pretty sure page locked memory [...] never gets written to swap.

on a windows box, there are multiple ways of telling the OS not to swap a memory block. but neither of those guarantees anything. i'm not a linux guy, but as i'm informed, you can't do that ony linux either.
