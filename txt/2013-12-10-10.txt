Well, theoretically you get two additional bits of security, no more. That
is quite marginal.

are you sure about that? the way i read it is 2 bits plus the
uncertainty of the running time. if the true time is 100ms, but the
attacker sets the stopping condition to 1600ms, we have a factor of
16, a 4 bit additional strengthening. still not a game changer though.

That is exactly the benefit of Boyen's paper. The user doesn't set a
parameter, the user waits as long as she is willing to wait, and then 
stops.

this is exactly the design i'm against. the first time the user faces
this, he will just sit and think, hm, how strong i want it to be?
maybe now it is good? just a little bit more security for me. okay,
click now. and then he will be extremely upset to find out that every
login takes 7 seconds. further, after registering on pc, every login
from his phone takes a 100 seconds. no way you convince any commercial
websites to use that method, instead of offering a list of low end
pc / high end pc / smartphone / tablet presets.

A disadvantage is, of course, that the scheme is all about the time, and
not the memory usage.

we don't want that in fact. memory should be based on what the
hardware offers. with the caveats listed above.
