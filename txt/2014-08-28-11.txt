Well, there is no "multiplication hardening" or anything of the
sort if we assume that the underlying sponge is Blake2, but that is
not strictly the case: Lyra2 does not impose any restriction on
what is the underlying hash, as it was designed as a sponge-based
wrapper around a hash function. We did use Blake2 in our
implementation, but any iterative hash function would do the
trick.

Notice that this characteristic can be considered good ("it is 
flexible") or bad ("it transfers the burden of the choice to the
user"), depending on how you see it, so I cannot say that this is
any kind of advantage of Lyra2 over any other candidate.

BR,

Marcos.

I like that design choice.  I may have to see if I can add a
multiplication chain to it.
