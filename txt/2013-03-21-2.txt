Discovered & responsibly reported to Cisco by Jens Steube (+friend). Jens happens to be atom@...hcat.net, who should be a well-known person to this list I guess. ;-)

Hi,

Reported by H-Online

"Weakened password hashing found in Cisco devices"

http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Weakened-password-hashing-found-in-Cisco-devices-1827197.html

"The algorithm was incorrectly implemented in version 15 of Cisco's IOS operating system, so that instead of using an 80-bit "salt" value, it used none, and instead of an intended 1000 iterations through SHA256, it used only one."

What can be worst ? :/

Regards.
