Subject: end of Gmane

Hello,

it seems that Gmane.org has shut down last month:
https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2016/07/28/the-end-of-gmane/

This was where this mailing-list was archived, and the PHC website
indicates as much. So we are in need of a new hosting somewhere for the
mailing-list archives. Any idea or suggestion?

(It seems www.archive.org did not scoop up the emails.)

The PHC Web site is hosted somewhere, so putting a copy of the archive
on the same machine might be relevant. Alternatively, I have a server
that sits idle most of the time, so I could contribute some hosting
space if needed.
