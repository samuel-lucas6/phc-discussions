Thanks Dmitry.

The updated specification does not correctly describe blake2b_long.
Going by the reference implementation, V_m+1 should be defined by
V_m+1 =  H_min(τ, 33+(τ-1 mod 32))(V_m), and is never absent. (m is
then m = max(0, ⌊(τ-33)/32⌋))

I would prefer a return to the originally specified output function
(iterate a 64-byte hash, appending 32 bytes to the output until τ is
reached), which is easier both to describe and implement. The only
advantage i can see of the new version is that it performs one fewer
iteration of H, but the cost of H is surely dwarfed by the overall
Argon2 computation. I don't believe it is worth the additional
complexity.
