descrypt, bcrypt, and scrypt all have theoretical timing attacks, 
yet offline attacks for these algorithms have certainly not 
declined.

I believe a timing attack that actually reveals the password is 
pretty far-fetched. The best you can probably hope for is leaking 
some information that enables early-reject for offline attacks,
and that's provided you have the hash+salt in addition to the side 
channel. And if an attacker only has the side channel and doesn't 
have the salt, the side channel attack is largely irrelevant.

I tend to agree the attack is still mostly theoretical.  However, I
think it is worth adding a bit of complexity to defend against timing
attacks, so long as it does not significantly weaken the main defense.
 I added an additional loop to TwoCats, where the first is
timing-attack resistant, but the second loop is unpredictable. Scrypt
also has a timing-resistant first loop, but with it's low memory
requirement, a cache timing attack is pretty strong.

It does make the algorithm more complex.  It's not an easy call.  I
consider several entries that make no attempt at timing defense of any
kind as still strong candidates.  I would rather have one of those
defending my passwords than a pure timing-attack resistant algorithm.
 Unpredictability puts extra hurt on brute-force attackers.
