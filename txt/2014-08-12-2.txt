Subject: Re: [PHC] Vertcoin moving to Lyra2

PHC candidates can also specify their parameters for use in
cryptocurrencies, so that we could compare the security of different
schemes in the same application. However we have to specify the upper bound
on the running time of such scheme, which would be OK for existing
cryptocurrencies.

One approach could be to require the hash computation taking less time that
needed to verify all transactions in the block. Given that an average
Bitcoin block has 80 transactions and each signature takes 10^6 CPU cycles
to verify on the recent CPUs
http://bench.cr.yp.to/impl-sign/ecdonaldp256.html , we obtain that the hash
computation should take no more than 1/40th of a second on a 3.2 GHz CPU.

It looks from their timeframe that they can't wait for the PHC to
complete, which is unfortunate.  As we discussed at Passwords, having a
crypto currency adopt the PHC winner would give us good benchmark data on
the speed and cost of computing the function with custom hardware.

I actually started following the PHC to track the development of
yescrypt.  I'm mostly interested in PHC competitors for use as Proof of
Work algorithms, especially for crypto currencies.  I had not really looked
much into Lyra2 before the Vertcoin announcement.

I think the main thing is coin developers wanting to move away from
Scrypt, since there are some very high end Scrypt ASICs on the market now.
Most attempts at making a new ASIC resistant coin have been based on
stacking a bunch of SHA3 competitors in a row, which is just ridiculous.
There have been some slightly better attempts, such as MemoryCoin, and
PrimeCoin went for about a year before someone managed to create a highly
optimized GPU miner.  YaCoin (scrypt with a higher N value) has actually
done a good job, but their poor marketing skills means they are still very
much under appreciated.

Look up "cpu coin" or "cpu mining" and you can see that despite the large
amount of interest in such a thing, the field is relatively
underdeveloped.  I think the reason Vertcoin is sticking with "GPU
Friendly" claims is mostly because anyone claiming to be CPU only
eventually falls to the GPU miners.

this would be interesting, if they were providing any details on why they
chose lyra2. but their blog lists only one feature, decoupled memory and
computation cost. any insider info on the rationale?
