Hi. 

Lyra contrasts it's reverse order to bit-reversal, and adopted a
cache-timing-resistant first loop in what I call a "hybrid"
architecture. I'm hopeful I might have influenced this decision to
go hybrid, but it was probably Catena. IIRC, the original Lyra had
little cache-timing attack resistance (like Scrypt), but I could be
wrong.
Don't underestimate yourself, Bill: your discussion on the Setup of Catena and Lyra made us think more about it, so you did influence the design of Lyra2. :-) 

OTOH, to be honest we were focusing on time-memory trade-offs rather than obtaining better cache-timing resistance. Lyra2 is indeed more resistant to cache-timing attacks than Lyra, but this was a "plus" rather than our original goal. That being said, it is hard to say if the resistance obtained is good enough, and that is why I would rather put this as a potential weakness as mentioned in my other e-mail. 

BR, 

Marcos.
