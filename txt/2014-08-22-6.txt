OK, then all the hybrid designs are *not* cache timing resistant.

cache-timing data. 

Do they?

The very least the adversary can see from the hybrid designs is if the 
password is the same (same data access pattern) or has been changed 
(completely different data access pattern). This doesn't immediately help 
to find the password, but it can still be useful information ...
