I already made significant changes to the spreadsheet.  In particular,
I needed to break up GPU defense into 3 memory hardness categories,
just like I did for ASICs.  Basically, Yescrypt wins across them all,
but for high memory hashing, GPUs will be massively memory bandwidth
limited, and can only gain at most a factor of the ratio of bandwidths
vs the CPU to it's memory.  I have absolutely no idea where the small
memory reads become the dominant factor over GDDR bandwidth.  The
numbers I put in are unfortunately a total WAG for GPU cracking times.
 However, at 8KiB, I think we act more like bcrypt, and the small
memory reads probably dominate the runtime, and the 3-to-1 speed
factor of Yescrypt to TwoCats may be real.

Unfortunately, these GPU numbers are a total WAG on my part.
