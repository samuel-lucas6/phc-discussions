A common use-case for a password hashing schemes is password based key
derivation. Cryptographers assume that keys to be random. This
assumption is crucial for the security of almost all cryptographic
schemes. Therefore, (for an adversary) the output of a good password
hashing scheme should be indistinguishable from random. Hence, dieharder
is IMHO a valid sanity check tool.

In that case, you might be happy to know that Catena passed :-)
