I'm pretty sure page locked memory [...] never gets written to swap.

on a windows box, there are multiple ways of telling the OS not to swap a
memory block. but neither of those guarantees anything. i'm not a linux guy,
but as i'm informed, you can't do that ony linux either.

I expect both OSes have ways of allocating non-paged memory. But bad things^TM will happen if you use too much of it.

These PHC algorithms will need to be tunable to consume lots of memory. Even worse, once the credentials have been stored its parameters will no longer be tunable.

+1 on encrypting the address bus, although doing this in such a way that doesn't put the defender at a disadvantage presents a challenge.
