I really hope there's something good here.  I would love to see a
really good anti-SIMD moving forward, not that my opinion counts.

Can I rewrite your code this way?

depth = 0
while true:
    if coinFlip()
        depth++
    else
        depth--
    if depth <= 0:
        return
    switch depth:
    case 1:
        do_work_1()
    case 2:
        do_work_2()
    ...
    case N:
        do_work_N()


Your code doesn't emulate where execution stays in the outer loop and
doesn't enter the inner loop.  I think you need to add a depth-- after
all of the cases.

Also, your case 1, case2, ... case n structure doesn't have a stack to
it so it can't emulate nested loops like:

while (coinflip()) {
   do_some_work();

   while (coinflip()) { ... }

   do_some_more_work();
}

You'd need a way of supporting cases nestled within other cases and
that needs a stack-like datastructure.
