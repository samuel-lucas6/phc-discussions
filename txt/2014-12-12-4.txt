Another reason is that without a salt, the attacker can pre-compute
lookup tables before they get access to the hashes. In terms of
organized crime that means there'll be large-scale cracking services
that can invest in creating MASSIVE rainbow tables and make a profit
selling access to them. With salt, that entire effort has to be re-done
for each breach (and hash within a breach).
