Subject: Forgot Password Conjectures....

 There are people out there researching & doing some really 
interesting work into improving password resets now. The https link via 
unencrypted email is easily accessible by many more than your favorite 
.gov agency, and doing it over SMS instead doesn't really raise the bar 
much for falling victim to a targeted attack. All that, in combination 
with 2FA too often being a usability bolt-on disguising as better 
security imho deserves a FSCK.


Per,

I would love to hear more on this. The OWASP foundation has a living 
document on this topic and I would be grateful for any help to give 
better advice.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet

While we are on the topic, I'd also love any review and edit suggestions 
to...

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet

These are all open source documents meant to help inform developers to 
do the right thing. I appreciate any help from you.

Aloha,
Jim Manico

Password policies are usually written by paranoid computer security
engineers, and they are almost never implemented as in writing, due to
constraints and sysadmins.

The same applies to most of the ecosystem around account registration
& password resets.

I have hopes for #passwords15 in Las Vegas (August) to perhaps shed
some additional light on these topics, and next iteration after that
will probably December 7-9 at the university in Cambridge, UK.

CFP submissions most welcome.
