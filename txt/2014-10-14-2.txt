This is surely not a main topic, but especially password hashing schemes
have long execution times and uses large amounts of memory, so a cold
boot attack or the risk of swapping is more relevant than for other
crypto topics.

that is why i rang the bells some time ago about filling up large
portions of memory with password dependent data. keeping the password
for a long time is not too dangerous, and even can be forced into the
cpu (some simd registers?). but having many megabytes of data that
essentially in 1:1 relationship with the password is something to be
wary of. even in a scenario where you can recover a small fraction of
the data with high error rate, it acts like a supermassive error
correction code.

i was hoping to see candidates that can be blinded, but the only one
with a chance seems to be makwa, however it does not use large memory.
but certainly, if we want low overhead blinding, we need some
"mathematical" hashing as opposed to PRF based. for PRFs, the general
option is to encrypt. but it adds cost to the defender, while not the
attacker. i wonder if it makes sense anyways. salsa20/12 with a random
key seems to be nice solution. it can trivially be added to any phc
candidate using RAM, but promotes 512bit memory granularity.
