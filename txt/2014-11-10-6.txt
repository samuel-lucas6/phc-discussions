Judging from our graphs you might have confused the instances of
Catena. Catena-DBG should require about 1.5 times the size of
Catena-BRG and it does so in our tests. Also Catena and Catena-BRG
should be absolutely equal in all categories.

The output length of Catena is limited to the output length of
underlying hash function. Hence, for Blake2b and SHA512 the max output
length is 64-byte.
We actually made a small mistake there. The fix is already on my
github repository and should be merged into the main one soon.
