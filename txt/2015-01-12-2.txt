If you look closely, you can see that this wafer is not an array of
smaller chips. It is *one big circuit*, possibly some kind of CCD
imager for a telescope or imaging satellite.

Of course, such a large circuit is likely to result in a low yield,
which perhaps explains how they ended up in the kitsch supply chain.
But it is an existence proof that wafer-sized circuits are possible,
modulo thermal solutions.

Note that CCD imagers are tolerant to small defects. A typical CCD will
feature a few bad pixels (possibly even a full bad line), for whom the
value will be interpolated from adjacent pixels.

What makes chip cost rise faster-than-linearly with area is defects; a
larger chip increases the probability that it will include a local
defect, and a chip with a defect is ditched entirely (this is the part
where things are not linear). If the chip design is tolerant to defects
(to some extent), then it can be substantially cheaper; CCD are in that
case.
