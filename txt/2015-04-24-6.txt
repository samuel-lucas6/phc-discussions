expiration yes, but it is not reckless. it is merely an inconvenience.
Yes. My bad. Reckless was overstated.

and we are not talking about months here. we are talking about years.
I'm pretty sure that this is a common time span for at least some scenarios.

so the downside is passwords will expire after a year or two, and the
user must proceed with the forgotten password routine. i don't think
it is that bad.
I just personally have a great aversion of forgotten password routines
when it comes to usability and security. Maybe I just haven't seen a
good one yet.
