Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
discussions@...sword-hashing.net mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at discussions-owner@...sword-hashing.net.

To confirm that you would like

   pvh@...tmail.com

added to the discussions mailing list, please send
an empty reply to this address:

   discussions-sc.1430771075.iiiijndgkjeafkbgankh-pvh=fastmail.com@...sword-hashing.net

Usually, this happens when you just hit the "reply" button.
If this does not work, simply copy the address and paste it into
the "To:" field of a new message.

This confirmation serves two purposes. First, it verifies that I am able
to get mail through to you. Second, it protects you in case someone
forges a subscription request in your name.

Some mail programs are broken and cannot handle long addresses. If you
cannot reply to this request, instead send a message to
<discussions-request@...sword-hashing.netand put the
entire address listed above into the "Subject:" line.


--- Administrative commands for the discussions list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

For help and a description of available commands, send a message to:
   <discussions-help@...sword-hashing.net>

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <discussions-subscribe@...sword-hashing.net>

To remove your address from the list, just send a message to
the address in the ``List-Unsubscribe'' header of any list
message. If you haven't changed addresses since subscribing,
you can also send a message to:
   <discussions-unsubscribe@...sword-hashing.net>

For addition or removal of addresses, I'll send a confirmation
message to that address. When you receive it, simply reply to it
to complete the transaction.

If you need to get in touch with the human owner of this list,
please send a message to:

    <discussions-owner@...sword-hashing.net>

Please include a FORWARDED list message with ALL HEADERS intact
to make it easier to help you.
