SQL injection, remote includes, local includes, and straight RCE flaws
are by and large the biggest ways password hashes are compromised. More
often than not, these vulnerabilities can be leveraged to view arbitrary
files, or in the best case scenario, obtain a shell running under the
context of the httpd or webapp.

If the attacker can obtain a shell under the same uid as the webapp
process and go undetected for a while, then he can ptrace the webapp and
see the passwords as they're being passed into the hashing function.
