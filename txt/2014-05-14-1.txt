Subject: Re: [PHC] PHS API copyright?

The submissions all include intellectual property statements, so it
seems that the PHC website only requires a disclaimer of liability. I
added that one, copied verbatim from eSTREAM:

"The information on this web site is provided as is, and no guarantee
or warranty is given or implied that the information is fit for any
particular purpose. The user thereof uses the information at his or
her sole risk and liability."

By having the same signature, it also allows test programs to swap out function pointers for maximally-fair comparisons.

While I too am shocked by the recent court ruling about APIs, it's hard to imagine it will be a huge impact on PHC. Jean-Philippe is "discussing this with qualified people".

Don't worry, we'll do the right thing.
