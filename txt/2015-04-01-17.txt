just a quick question: wouldn't it be easier and more precise to
calculate the memory requirement instead of measuring it? it should be
quite straightforward from the algorithms.

And would also avoid making mistakes like crediting an algorithm for
more than it actually needs due to malloc overhead or the like. It's
not bad to look at the rusage data since it should always be higher
than the actual usage, and might catch some mistake... but it
shouldn't be the definitive figure as an attacker (or mature
implementation) is going to happily optimize out whatever excess
overheads you're accidentally counting with it.

For the most part with at least 8 MiB they line up. Catena-Butterfly is the odd
ball.
