Milan is generously benchmarking on PowerPC, but isn't that a mostly dead architecture?


Not dead, just really expensive. Apple killed off our source of commodity PPC hardware. However, I fully expect OpenPOWER to change this. They may not make a huge dent in x86's market share, but will certainly make PPC more accessible and more common than it is now. And most importantly, prove that it's not dead ;)
