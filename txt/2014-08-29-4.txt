OK, you asked for it.  I don't recall all of my complaints about TwoCats
anymore, but I think its small random lookups, which are meant to be
bcrypt-like, might not actually provide as much GPU resistance as
bcrypt's did.  I think TwoCats makes them 256-bit only, meaning that on
pre-AVX2 CPUs they might not be frequent enough, and you might not be
making enough of them per byte read/written to the large arena.  Have
you actually checked TwoCats vs. defense-optimized bcrypt running on the
same CPU when exhausting the machine's capacity (e.g., 8 independent
concurrent hash computations on your i7-3770), in terms of frequency of
those small random lookups?  And then you need to factor in how soon
their results are needed (the available parallelism, compare it against
bcrypt's four S-box lookups) and the total size of your equivalent of
bcrypt S-boxes (if 4x larger, then you probably have 4x more room for
parallelism while staying the same as bcrypt in terms of GPU resistance).

... or not so much room, since global memory attacks become a concern
when lookups are less frequent and/or parallelism is higher, and these
are not affected by S-box size (until it becomes many times larger than
our L1 cache, so not in our case).
