yescrypt's claimed area-time product at t_cost = 0 is
lower, at (1/3+1/3)/(1/2+1/3) = 80% of what's theoretically possible for
its running time (e.g., of what TwoCats tried to achieve).

Speaking of what TwoCats tried to achieve...

Has anyone done any estimates of the compute-time hardness of the
various finalists at various setting levels?  E.g. what is the cost
for attacker with infinite memory area and bandwidth? (sorry if I've
missed a thread; just point me to it if I have)
