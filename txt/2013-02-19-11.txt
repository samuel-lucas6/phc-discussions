I'm not familiar with everyone on the panel, but I think it would be useful to have someone with an understanding of having to deal with a large number of legitimate authentication sessions.  Someone who, say, manages Gmail logins (IMAP, web, etc) may have insight into what sorts of cost parameters they would like to have.

Basically, it would be really sucky to settle upon a winner and then have sites and services say, "we won't use that because we can't manage our verification costs the way we need to."

I am not exactly "with" a company of this sort, but I do have such
insight.  Specifically, the required performance numbers used in my
ZeroNights presentation are not arbitrary.  For some companies, a
throughput of more than ~1000/s per authentication server is required,
and latencies of more than ~10 ms are costly in terms of request queue
size growth on other servers.
