Alexander's technique of counting sequential operations, and giving

Use 8 and you'll be closer to reality, IMO.

I agree.  All we know is it's somewhere between 3 and 32.

The algorithms also need careful analysis to be  sure an attacker can't
start computing the next operation before the previous one is done, or at
least take into account the potential speedup.  A chain of additions, for
example, let's you propagate the low bits very fast compared to the high
bits.  I feel good about both the reduced Blake2b round and Yescrypt's
PWXFORM round here.

I thought of this yesterday, and my gut feeling is that there might be
some minimal speedup for some of the sequences in Blake2b here.
