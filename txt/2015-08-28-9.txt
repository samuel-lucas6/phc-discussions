If the ASIC running time is about the same as for CPU (which is reasonable

This is the main reason I want to use the new MAXFORM feature in Argon2.
Without MAXFORM, I estimate an attacker can make use of 320 GiB/s of
bandwidth without being computation speed limited.  With MAXFORM, I
estimate he can make use of only 40 GiB/s before hitting the computation
speed wall.

That 8x free parallelism in Argon2's compression function is my least
favorite thing about Argon2.  MAXFORM fixes it, while providing GPU
resistance and more.
