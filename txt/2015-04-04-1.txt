Subject: Re: [PHC] Allowing Agon2 and Catena2?

FTR: After the finalists selection submitters were allowed to submit
minor changes ("tweaks") to their submissions. The Argon designers
proposed a modified Argon, as well as Argon2, and let the panel decide
whether or not Argon2 ("major modification" as per its designers)
would be acceptable. The PHC panel decided not to replace Argon with
Argon2 in the finalists, for the simple reason that it's too much of a
change compared to the original Argon. It would've been unfair to
other submitters to make an exception.

Do we want to continue benchmarking Argon2d and Argon2i?  It is useful for
reference, but we're putting work into analyzing Argon2 that should go
elsewhere if there is no chance Argon2 can be selected.  I find Argon2 to be
good work compared to Argon, and generally I don't care much for rules when
they hurt the world, so my preference is to drop Argon, and allow Argon2 to
go forward.  Is this possible?

The same goes for the new Catena version, and I'd also like to allow them to
add any H hash function they need to, including the reduced Blake2b
single-round hash.  I think the world would be better off with Argon2i and
Catena2 duking it out for the cache-timing-resistant category, and Lyra2,
Yescrypt, and Argon2d duking it out for the Scrypt upgrade category.

Anyway, some guidance here would be useful at a minimum for benchmarking and
security analysis efforts.
