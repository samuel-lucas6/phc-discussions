but, interestingly, upon generation, it will output a string that starts
with '$5$rounds=', not '$5,rounds='. For "Solaris", I mean here what I
think I understand from the source code of the opensource fork illumnos,
under the possibly bold assumption that recent versions of Solaris (from
Oracle) still behave that way.

As the original author and maintainer of that code in Solaris I can 
confirm that Solaris does still behave the same way for crypt_sha256 as 
you have observed from Illumos source.
