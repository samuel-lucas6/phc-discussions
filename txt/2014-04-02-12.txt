I don't mind at all if people are criticizing our design.  (As you
correctly stated below, this is not about unicorns...)

Apart from that, in my opinion, all criticism about AntCrypt so far was
about portability and minor details that are easily fixable.  And if
some of our ideas are considered interesting and potentially even
influence future designs, that's even better.

If you're concerned about picking on the AntCrypt author then skip
ahead from A to O or some other letter :-)

One might consider randomizing the order how submissions are listed :-)

All the best,
Markus
