We are not, we are in the business of making sure that entropy is

Some of the PHC candidates claim to be key derivation functions. In
those cases we most assuredly do care about this. It would mean that the

​No, PHK's definition was, probably provably, correct (for password hash or
key derivation)​, assuming the *full* output is being used.




POMELO's submission document doesn't use the words "key derivation
function", but it does claim collision resistance. But if you can find a
sequence of inputs which causes the outputs to fails the
diehard_birthdays test, then obviously you've reduced its collision
resistance to at least something less than 2**(outlen/2) (for outlen
expressed in bits). In this case, inputs of 0, 1, 2, 3... did the job.

Collision resistance is different from "estimating" entropy in specific
bits, which is a different - albeit important for KDFs - kettle of fish.
