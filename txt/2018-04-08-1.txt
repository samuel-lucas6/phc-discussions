Hi,

I’m in the process of switching the default hasher of the Python cffi bindings to Argon2id as recommended in <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-03#section-4and noticed that the draft expired more than two months ago.

Is anyone still pursuing this project or is it on ice for now? I wonder if I should link to it from the docs at all if its the latter? It puts me in a bit of a funny situation because it contradicts the Argon2 specs at <https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/argon2-specs.pdf>.

Cheers,
—h
