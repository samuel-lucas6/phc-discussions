Hi Marcos,

It took some time, but we finally completed the GPU benchmarks mentioned

Have you made any further progress on this since May?

I'd like to let you know that Agnieszka Bielec working with us on
integrating support for PHC finalists into John the Ripper, including on
GPU, appears to have achieved a 3x+ speedup for Lyra2 over your CUDA
code, as currently tested at t_cost=8, m_cost=8, N_COLS=256, nPARALLEL=2
(your defaults).  I think this corresponds to 192 KiB per instance:

The current choice of 8 and 8 is arbitrary.  We should test with other
settings as well.  Especially with the lowest t_cost, and higher m_cost,
and with nPARALLEL=1.
