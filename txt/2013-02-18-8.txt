One notable exception to this that I can think of is if you e.g. have
some (possibly global) secret which is loaded from e.g. disk instead
of the database--then attackers who are only able to leverage a SQL
injection vulnerability would not be able to do much with the
salt+digests from the database.

Please keep in mind that SQL injection can be leveraged to do a lot more
than just dump the database. It can also be used to read artibrary
files, and in some cases, obtain a shell running in the context of the
database or webapp.
