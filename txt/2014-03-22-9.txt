This reasonable assumption implies that profit oriented companies will
not delete old password hashes.

they also won't use expensive password hashes or forward secrecy.
except if the customer demands it. not necessarily in form of a piece
of technology they don't even understand. but for example in form of
badges. imagine something like "Forler Security seal of approval". if
it has value, and sooner or later it will, those profit oriented
companies will start using everything you say to them.
