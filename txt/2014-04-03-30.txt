Anyway this is a non-issue if they just change it from (x is the

g ** x (mod N)

x ** e (mod N)

For what it's worth, this is indeed how things are done in Makwa: the
intermediate value is raised to exponent e = 2**w, where w is the "time
cost parameter". If you make sure that N is a Blum integer (N = pq where
p and q are prime and both are equal to 3 modulo 4) then there seems to
be no known shortcut for this computation in the general case (you have
to compute w modular squarings), unless p and q are known.
