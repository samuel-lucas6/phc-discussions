That was _so_ last November. Why do you have to bring up the past? :P


Personally, I think the deadline is fine as it is: it's been
advertised for a year.

A year is not a very long time. Some people (not me, of course) only
found out about the competition a few months ago. Some people will not
find out about it until Monday. Maybe a year is not long enough. But
maybe it is.

I personally would like to see it extended just because I haven't found
any time at all to work on my submission since October, and I'm really
sweating the deadline. Nov - Feb are extremely hectic for me, as I
imagine they are for many of you as well. I am strongly in favor of the
revised timeline.
