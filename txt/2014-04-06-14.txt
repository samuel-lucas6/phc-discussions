We know that, but they don't, no matter how big we write it on the web
site/final specification/media announcement.  If we don't set KDF-style
requirements then at some point someone is going to run the PHC-winner's
output through Dieharder and announce on Slashdot/a conference paper/front
page of the NY Times that the PHC chose a flawed algorithm, and no amount of
trying to explain the difference between a KDF and a PHC will overcome that.
So it had better act as a KDF, whether that was an original design goal or
not.
