Somebody substituted their own (bad) judgement over the (alleged
to exist) (better) design.

That is not a "subtle implementation error", that is a two failures
of management:

The first failure is that the substitution happened on a so security
critical algorithm without any management control mechanism catching
it.

The second failure is that Q/A failed to detect it too, because
they did not test such a security critical algorithm against the
(alleged to exist) design.
