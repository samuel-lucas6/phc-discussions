There are basically two thresholds.  It hurts a lot when we bust out of
on-chip memory for any of these technologies.  Currently, that thresho

This on-chip memory is very expensive, so a KDF using low memory, like
10MB, should be super-fast and do lots of random accesses and sequential
operations.  However, an ASIC run a lot faster than our CPUs, so you wont
tie up that ASIC doing a password guess for long.

​Thanks - that's really useful.​  So to thwart a GPU style attack at the
moment is fairly easy but the FPGA/ASIC minimum lower bound is a fair bit
higher than I had expected (I was thinking ~10Mb range but looks like 32Mb
or thereabouts is going to be the minimum).

Once you are over about 30MB, you're in off-chip territory, meaning it's
stored in something like GDDR5 for a GPU, or DDR3 for an ASIC or FPGA.  An
attacker has to pay basically the same as you and I for this memory, and
there are bandwidth limitations:

ASIC:                       256 GB/s

Basically, these GPUs and FPGAs are as expensive as a desktop computer,
but they deliver 10X the memory bandwidth.  Filling up that bandwidth may
be the best defense against hardware-based attackers.  The custom ASIC
could possibly be cheaper, but there's a huge up-front cost.  Keeping
attackers stuck at only a 10X cost*time advantage seems doable.  That's a
lot of protection for all those really bad passwords out there.

Normally I'd have said an ASIC implementation would be unlikely but ​given
scrypt has already been implemented in ASIC for mining Litecoin* we can
probably work under the assumption that it may be a threat.


​[*] - I think it quoted around 25m scrypt hashes per second​, which
although isn't fantastic and I think at least 2 orders of magnitude lower
than GPU implementations against common password hashes, it's likely to get
better.
