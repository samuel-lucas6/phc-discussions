Subject: Build your own Catena

Hi.
We have just released Catena-Variants, a flexible C++ version of the
Catena framework:
https://github.com/medsec/catena-variants
It allows you to swap the internal parts of Catena without having to
recompile. Adding or modifying new parts also became a lot easier.
We've included all standard parts of Catena, everything that didn't
make the cut into Catena v3 and two modifications by Bill Cox and Ben
Harris.
Catena-Variants contains an application to benchmark the impact of
your modifications and another one to create test vectors for a given
set of parameters.

Sincerely
Sascha Schmidt (on behalf of the Catena team)
