worth.  Is it worth running 50% longer, or only 3% longer?

I think it depends on use case.  You shouldn't universally say that
leaking memory contents is the primary threat; for many (most?) use
cases and threat models, it is not.

When I added runtime self-test and zeroization to crypt_blowfish, I
measured its cost at 0.6% at the $2a$08 bcrypt cost setting.  I think
this is a good tradeoff.  3% might be (barely) acceptable too.  50%
definitely not, although it could be OK as a non-default option (but
then having that option might not be worth the complexity).
