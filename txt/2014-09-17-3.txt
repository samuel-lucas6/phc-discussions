i picked omegacrypt because i just spotted this. out of the 3,
antcrypt seems to be the worst, the other two can get away with some
blinding (dummy operations), but you can't compensate for differences
in floating point, as the timing is just unknown and depends on
zillions of factors, including the data itself.
