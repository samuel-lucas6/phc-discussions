I don't think my attack works with Catena 2, does it?

To a certain degree. :-)

The benefit decrees in a drastic way when you use Catena-2 instead of
Catena-1. It becomes even worse with Catena-3 and so on and so forth.

I hope not, because I just switched NoelKDF to use something very
similar to Catena 2 to eliminate timing attacks.  If Catena 2 has a
weakness, I would appreciate hearing about it.

Catena-\lambda, and especially Catena-2, is *NOT*
sequential-memory-hard. So you do always benefit from multiple cores.
For c cores you can theoretically speed up the performance to a factor
of O(c^(1/\lambda+1)). So, for c=1,000,000  you can speedup the
computation of Catena-2 by a factor of 100.

I'm mot sure if this is either acceptable or not. What do you think?



Best regards,
Christian
