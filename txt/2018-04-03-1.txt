Maybe even $8$ and $9$ for runners up like yescrypt and Lyra2?

We previously defined $7$ for scrypt and I already use $y$ for yescrypt.
Both are supported in the recently released yescrypt 1.0.0 tree.

Oh, and I almost forgot that $8$ and $9$ are also already taken, by
Cisco for PBKDF2 and scrypt, respectively, with certain parameters.

I think there's currently no need for anything else.
