Of course, generating a random *secure* cryptographic hash function is
NOT easy, since it takes years of design and testing to become confident
in just one. However, except for very valuable hashes, attackers
probably won't spend a lot of time cryptanalyzing them, so it's OK for
them to be not-so-secure.

Does anyone know of existing similar work?

The closest thing I've heard of along these lines is the AES candidate FROG:
