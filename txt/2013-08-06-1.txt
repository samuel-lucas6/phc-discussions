Subject: Another experimental hash

In the spirit of JP's proposal, another simple design:

https://gist.github.com/trevp/6160461

It's parallelizable, so multiple cores can be used by good guys (and
not just crackers).

It also spends almost all time doing AES-CBC on chunks of data.  So it
can be implemented efficiently in a "slow" language like python,
provided a fast AES-CBC is available.
