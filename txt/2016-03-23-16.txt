A while ago, I looked, and it seemed like all the security analysis of
the Salsa20 permutation assumed that a bunch of the input words to the
core permutation were fixed.  In the Even-Mansour scheme, they would
be under strong attacker control.  Did I miss something?

No; I was thinking of ChaCha20, which is better behaved, when writing the above. I withdraw the suggestion.
