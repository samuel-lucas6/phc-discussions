This is why we see these submissions.

Right, however, we (and apparently others as well) feel that Adobe did
not do it the right way.
* Three branches is not enough to seriously impact speed,
* I assume that some fraction of the three diverging branches can still
be executed in parallel, and
* The branches are quite long (an entire hash computation), so it may
pay off to re-arrange the guesses so you can always compute one hash
function per block.

There are only maybe 30 different instructions that need to be
executed, at least if the shift distance is computed rather than

This is precisely the reason why we tried to use "esoteric functions"
(i.e. floating point arithmetic) in our proposal,  as it increases the
number of available functions.  (It also requires relatively large space
on ASICS, and has certain drawbacks that have been discussed already...)
