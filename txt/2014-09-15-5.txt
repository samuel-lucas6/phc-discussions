Hash: SHA1

I agree with your point, if _admins_ choose very weak passwords
(<32 bits of entropy).  However, if admins are choosing passwords
with very low entropy, then brute force over the network is also a
big risk though.

Will any hashing scheme protect an admin account that chooses
'password' or 'abc123' as their password?  (At least PPH protects
thresholdless accounts even with these horrid passwords.)

Making admins choose passwords that aren't completely broken seems
to be a viable task.  Many organization already try to require this
for all users by requiring some numbers / letters / min length,
etc.

As always, the feedback / discussion is appreciated... Justin


Just another thought... you could require during initial boot that
admins log in with additional authentication factors, which could be
something like Google Authenticator, or even just answering some
security questions (or even both).  Then, once the system has derived
the secret key, they could log in with just their password.  This
would be only slightly annoying to admins because the extra factors
would only be required occasionally, while providing a significant
security boost in case of a database leak.

Instead of leaking part of their password hash, you could just have an
additional hash, one for normal use using the secret key, and one with
a high level of security for logging in before the secret key is
available.

Would something like that work?
