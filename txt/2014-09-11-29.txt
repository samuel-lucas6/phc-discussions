I should have said ROM-only token as opposed to token w/o storage.
Incidentally, Intel SGX looks a lot like a ROM-only token built in to
a CPU :)

I'm thinking of it like an ssh private key file with added two-factor
goodness.

Well, my opinion on SSH private keys in files (as opposed to tokens) is 
"poor man's software token"...

It really is trying to fulfill "something you have", the passphrase for the 
key is "something you know" - but it's weakened as a "something you have" by 
being trivially cloneable.

It all comes down to the three proofs of identity - something you have, 
something you know, and something you are. Having _something_ is better than 
_nothing_ in each category, but you really don't benefit all that much by 
having more than one in a category.

You _do_ benefit in certain measures of security, but it starts costing more 
to get all of them to play nicely, and you start losing out on 
complexity/robustness grounds. To me, that's a huge problem, because 
Security Hole Zero is "the tools were a pain so I didn't use them."

It's the single most common security problem, whether it manifests as poor 
passwords, reused passwords, sticky notes with passwords on them, leaving 
two-factor authentication turned off because they don't want to type a 6-
digit code on login...

If I find myself bored enough, I'll try to implement something in the
Java card edition or whatever it's called and see if I can upload it
to my YK NEO. *

* Old YK NEOs are unlocked and you can upload applets.  New ones are
locked, but I think you can email Yubico and ask for the developer
version.
