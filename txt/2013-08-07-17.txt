The general idea is that you don't keep everything in memory
you're supposed to, but only an occasional checkpoint. From
this checkpoint you can recompute memory near it. Often it's
a good choice to keep sqrt(n) checkpoints from which you can
recompute any value you're interested in in time n/sqrt(n)=sqrt(n).

<lightbulb>Oh!</lightbulb>

I think we call that "rainbow tables"!
