Thanks for posting this Dean.

It looks from their timeframe that they can’t wait for the PHC to complete, which is unfortunate.  As we discussed at Passwords, having a crypto currency adopt the PHC winner would give us good benchmark data on the speed and cost of computing the function with custom hardware.

More details about the switch here :

I actually started following the PHC to track the development of yescrypt.  I'm mostly interested in PHC competitors for use as Proof of Work algorithms, especially for crypto currencies.  I had not really looked much into Lyra2 before the Vertcoin announcement.

I think the main thing is coin developers wanting to move away from Scrypt, since there are some very high end Scrypt ASICs on the market now.  Most attempts at making a new ASIC resistant coin have been based on stacking a bunch of SHA3 competitors in a row, which is just ridiculous.  There have been some slightly better attempts, such as MemoryCoin, and PrimeCoin went for about a year before someone managed to create a highly optimized GPU miner.  YaCoin (scrypt with a higher N value) has actually done a good job, but their poor marketing skills means they are still very much under appreciated.

Look up "cpu coin" or "cpu mining" and you can see that despite the large amount of interest in such a thing, the field is relatively underdeveloped.  I think the reason Vertcoin is sticking with "GPU Friendly" claims is mostly because anyone claiming to be CPU only eventually falls to the GPU miners.

this would be interesting, if they were providing any details on why they chose lyra2. but their blog lists only one feature, decoupled memory and computation cost. any insider info on the rationale?
