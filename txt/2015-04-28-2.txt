surprisingly hard to guestimate parallel thread performance from parallel
process performance.  The reasons remain mysterious to me, but the short
version is that each thread seems to want sole access to it's own page.
Mixing nearby read/writes between threads thrashes something, maybe the
translation lookaside buffer?

I would be interested, personally and as a panel member, to see those 3
candidates' (is that Argon2, Lyra2, yescrypt?) multi-threaded
performance included in Milan's reports.  Bill, maybe you can contribute
to Milan's code?  I think it's all on GitHub, so perhaps you can make a
pull request.

I've just forked the code, and I'll look into adding a PHS_thread or some
such thing.  Actually, it looks like the original Argon was enhanced to add
multi-threading, so technically there are four: Argon, Argon2 (i and d),
Lyra2, and Yescrypt.


BTW, Argon2 is still not formally accepted.  Yet I'd like to see more of
its benchmarks.

I do hope the panel accepts Argon2.  Without TwoCats in the competition, we
need Argon2d to keep you guys focused on bare metal performance :-)
