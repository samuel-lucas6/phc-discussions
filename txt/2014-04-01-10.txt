It is more than cool; it is highly recommended. The whole point of an
open cryptographic competition is to accumulate analysis, i.e. to have a
lot of people trying to break the algorithms. It is normal and expected
that submitters, in particular, will try real hard to break each other
algorithms.

I'd say that discussions on password hashing algorithms are appropriate
on a mailing-list whose address is 'discussions@...sword-hashing.net'.

Usually, academics discuss cryptography by gathering regularly, and,
when they cannot meet physically, exchange written information over
appropriate mediums. Historically, papyrus and then parchment were used,
but nowadays emails are preferred. When someone has a full, elegant and
non-trivial attack to demonstrate, he usually writes it down with the
traditional formalism (i.e. an 'article') and pushes it through the
various mechanisms (conferences with proceedings, and/or the IACR ePrint
archive: http://eprint.iacr.org/ ); for smaller, faster remarks, and,
yes, discussions, this present mailing-list is expected to be used. In
particular during the first pruning phase, during which the list of
candidates should be reduced (24 are fine, but maybe a bit too much for
available cryptanalytic resources).

At least that's how things worked for SHA-3. I don't remember if there
was a mailing-list for the AES competition.

As far as can I see, it is more a specification/implementation issue,
but maybe I don't see everything that is to be seen. E.g. I don't follow
the IRC channel (maybe I should ?).

For high-quality rational scientific debates, it is usually best if
people take time to structure their arguments and put them in due order;
so emails are a better format than chat-like interfaces. That's my
opinion.

Thanks for that info.  So, we'll discuss here, and the fun continues :-)

I have some comments for AntCrypt, but if we all read it first that
would be pretty miserable for the author.  I'll read them all and post
a laundry-list.  Nothing major, just weaknesses not acknowledged by
the authors.  Some of the authors, like EARWORM, listed everything he
could think of, and I have nothing so far to add, but probably half of
the ones I've read so far didn't list any weaknesses at all, and so I
have a list...
