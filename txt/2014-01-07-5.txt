A future PHC candidate?

Hm. If I understand the concept correctly, this is sort of similar to
the candidate I have been working on.

However, in the presentation linked on that site, the assertion on slide
8.2 (K20X only pulling 1.3 MH/s on MD5) is ludicrious. They're off by
three orders of magnitude, and then some. In reailty, the K20X can pull
about 5 GH/s on MD5, which is about what they reckoned the GPU could do
per hour. This leads me to believe they don't really have a firm grasp
on the attack landscape, which might mean they do not understand how an
attacker might implement and optimize Lyra. I'd have to study it more to
see if their claims hold up.

But yes, I think someone should reach out to them and see if they wish
to participate.
