If Alexander proposed to integrate his PWXFORM (I don't know what MAXFORM
is), then I would be for it.  This would satisfy my request for improved
GPU resistance, and also my request for multiplication-chain computation
time hardening.

MAXFORM is the scalar equivalent to (and subset of) pwxform.  It's
neither parallel, nor wide, but is otherwise the same.

It would co-exist with Argon2's existing SIMD code.

There are only two really outstanding SIMD-optimized mixing functions which
were used in this competition, IMO.  The choices are the reduced-Blake2
with or without it's multiplication modification, and PWXFORM.  I suspect
between Samuel Neves, Alexander, and the Argon2 team, they could figure out
the best solution.

Switching Argon2 to use pwxform would be too much of a change - not
code-wise, but design-wise.  If we were to do that, then it'd be better
to go with (simplified) yescrypt or the like instead, which we already
have separately (just not as the PHC winner).
