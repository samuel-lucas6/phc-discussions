Hi Bill

For the schvrch entry you may use proposed prng (the very last listing
appendix B) combining stir and revolve function only (the simpler construct
than schvrch).

Regards, Rade

I just realised how dumb it is to start with my own repo, rather than
a fork of Poul-Henning Kamp's.  I just forked his PHC repo.  I plan to
do only very minor edits in "master", which I can then use to submit
pull requests.  I'm creating a "testing" branch where I'll do all my
mechanical testing.  Any collaborators would be welcome.

I've set up my fork of Poul-Henning Kamp's PHC git repo where I'm
doing mechanical testing.  You can find the repo at:

Anyone interested in hacking the code will need to checkout the
"testing" branch.  I'm keeping the "master" branch clean so it will be
easy to pull updates to PHC entries from there.

I've got 14 compiling and running now.  The AntCrypt author might be
happy to hear his code passes the first 4 dieharder test.  I'm running
Argon now.  I'll have all 24 in maybe a couple days... some of them
just take forever to run even 4 tests.
