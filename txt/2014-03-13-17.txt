I never bought that argument. You can be DoS'ed in many, many ways. The
solution is exponential backoff and similar, not to (again) compromise on
the security of the password digests.

Has anyone who actually implemented automatic logouts for e.g. 10 failed
logins ever experienced a DoS because of their password authentication
function? Everybody brings it up, but nobody seems to have experienced it.
