If I am not mistaken, he has input collisions on both salt, and a
parameter called "pers".  Both are padded with 0's to 8 bytes, and
XOR-ed onto Blake2b state, so adding additional 0's up to a total
length of 8 doesn't change the output.  The password is free of such
collisions, so this isn't a critical issue.  He also has a spelling
error on the last line of his README :-)
