Since the two versions use different â€œindexing functions," I imagine that the time-space trade-off for the two schemes could be quite different. Version 1.0 was the PHC winner, so I am tempted to spend my time looking at v1.0. At the same time, if v1.2 is the version that the world will use (assuming that the world starts using Argon2) I should probably focus on v1.2.

Is one of these two versions the "authoritative" one? Are there known flaws in v1.0 that provide a rationale for using only v1.2? I looked through the mailing list archives, but was not able to find any discussion of Argon2 v1.2.

Argon2 v1.2 was announced on June 22 on this list, but appears to not have been archived. The announced modifications
were presented as an optional update to be considered post-PHC (i.e., now). Below I quote the announcement by Dmitry
Khovratovich:

Dear PHC community,
 following discussions in the PHC forum we decided to further increase the
circuit depth and improve the tradeoff resistance of Argon2. We propose an
optional update with two main changes:
>
1) The "random" memory block is not  uniformly selected but with a
distribution skewed towards later blocks. This gives both higher tradeoff
resilience and more uniform memory access. The distribution is similar to
that in TwoCats, though for the moment we slightly prefer quadratic (rather
than cubic) power function as it minimizes the AT gain for a tradeoff
attacker. The detailed design rationale is provided in the update
description.

2) The round function of Blake2b is replaced with BlaMka (each addition is
now accompanied with a 32x32 multiplication) in order to increase the
circuit depth. In total we add 512 MULs per 1-KB block with shortest chain
having 12 MULs.The structure of the compression function remains the same
for the moment (thus some extra parallelism is still in place), since such
a change apparently requires a very involved analysis.
>
Both modifications affect the performance (the first one increases the
speed, whereas the second one decreases it). In total, Argon2d (and
Argon2i) would run slower by 15% with multiple threads, and by 45% with 1
thread.

This update should be considered as a post-PHC modification, i.e. the one
that is deployed after the winner is declared.

The update is described in a separate chapter of the design document
(chapter 3 in  https://github.com/khovratovich/Argon2/blob/master/Argon2.pdf
).
Both optimized and reference implementations are ready for downloading and
testing in a separate branch
