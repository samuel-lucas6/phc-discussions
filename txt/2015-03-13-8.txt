 Another way I proposed is blind hashing / security by obesity. A very
large common data pool can provide offline attack resistance for a large
number of users at a very low cost per user. It's a very efficient way to
defend the hashes. Google 'blind hashing', and I would love your feedback.

I Googled Blind Hashing, and the top result is a patent titled Blind
Hashing.  At Google, we're forbidden from reading patents, so I did not
even read the summary.  Is your idea patented, or was this just a random
unrelated patent?
