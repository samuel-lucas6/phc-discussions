Hash: SHA1

The worst mistake I made during my reviews was accusing the RIG team
of trying to take credit for other people's ideas.  I still feel very
bad about it.  I was wrong, and I was the one being dickish.  I
strayed from attacking code into attacking authors, and that was stupid.

The RIG team independently came up with two great ideas.  First was
using the reduced Blake2b round, including the exact code from the
original author, just like the Lyra2 team.  This is a *very* high
performance hashing function which makes RIG the clear speed leader in
the cache-timing resistant category.  Second was XORing over data
rather than overwriting it, strengthening their TMTO defense without
causing much slowdown.  This helps correct a potential weakness
covered by the Argon authors in their cryptanalysis of Catena.

They also came up with the idea of writing only part of the hash to
memory, making it difficult to determine the Blake2b state.  This is
similar to how Lyra2 writes only part of their sponge's state to
memory.  RIGs idea also can be used to reduce memory usage, which in
some cases could be helpful.

The RIG team was creative and original.  Their code does need some
fixes, but I look forward to their update.  I found nothing in my code
review that cannot be fixed with tweaks.  I certainly hope the judges
did not take my tirade about RIG looking similar to other entries into
account when picking round 2 candidates.

Before picking them for round 2, I would prefer to see a code update,
but assuming it fixes the one critical bug, they seem like a strong
entry to me, from a code point of view.
