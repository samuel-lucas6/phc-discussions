My initial guess is not confirmed: I've just pulled the revised
wallet code with some unrelated(?) changes made to it (including my
changes to enable the SIMD code), and its 64-bit build works just
fine on the same system where a 64-bit build previously failed for
me.  So I guess the bug was different (and I guess it's still in
there and might show up again in some builds or after some more
changes).  I've e-mailed the developer with these observations.

They have another bug where if you start mining before syncing, you
wind up creating an alternate chain where people get stuck forever.

Oh, actually it might have been the same problem I saw.  I think I
started mining when connected, but before being fully sync'ed.  Now
sync'ing takes just a few seconds, but on the first day connections were
intermittent and sync'ing could have been slow.

They had trouble syncing people initially, so many of us just started
mining anyway, and that didn't work out.  I've switched to the main
chain, which required deleting my copy of everything and starting
over.  I've won 6 blocks so far with my son's MineCraft server, so
it's still fun.  He wants half :-)

Cool.

I've tried to figure out what hash rate people are getting now, from
pools' reported hash rates and worker count - but this appears to be
unreliable.  Two main BSTY pools' combined hash rate is about 1.5 times
higher than those same two pools' reported network hash rate (well, at
least they agree on the latter).

bsty.altpooler.com reports 4300 kh/s network, 3415 kh/s pool, 145 workers
bsty.nonce-pool.com reports 4300 kh/s network, 2712 kh/s pool, 117 workers

If the pool hash rate figures were correct, they'd correspond to
23k+ kh/s average speed per worker, which would be surprising, but not
impossible.  I expect Amazon's biggest CPU instance (2x E5-2680v2) to do
about 15k or maybe 16k kh/s with the current code, but some clusters use
bigger machines than Amazon's.  That said, I guess the pool hash rates
are erroneous/exaggerated by a factor of 1.5+, but I don't know why.
