Thanks for comment!

I am now polishing the spec so feel free to throw in more.

Great!

And about parallelism. It seems it's now allowed to be up to 255 but one
place in the spec is not updated: "Parallelism. Argon2 may use up to 64
threads in parallel, although in our experiments 8 threads already exhaust
the available bandwidth and computing power of the machine."
