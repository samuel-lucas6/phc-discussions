Subject: Re: [PHC] PHC status report

I would like to add more comments on the following new criteria.

1. Elegance of design
2. Originality and innovation

Unlike the criteria in art or literature, the criteria of standards or
algorithms related to the security of system should be able to be measured
by scientific ways.

Now, a question arises, "given an algorithm, how can we measure the
elegance of design and originality and innovation of the algorithm in
scientific ways?"

As far as I know, there were (or are) no such criteria in cases of AES,
SHA-3, Caesar competitions, because such criteria are not scientifically
measurable! I believe that they can be only measurable by a biased
favoritism!

In the link (https://password-hashing.net/index.html), it is written, "To
identify new password hashing schemes suitable for widespread adoption, the
PHC follows the model of focused cryptographic competitions such as AES,
eSTREAM, or SHA-3 (see the Cryptographic competitions
<http://competitions.cr.yp.to/website)." However, I wonder whether the
PHC follows the model of focused cryptographic competitions or not.

In the beginning of the competition, the criteria were clearly mentioned
from the following link.

However, as mentioned from another following link, when 9 candidates have
been recently selected, new criteria, which are totally unrelated to the
original ones, were added.

The two new criteria are added as follows:

1. Elegance of design
2. Originality and innovation

I wondered who added these new criteria, which were never mentioned
before, without the request of any permission of changing it internally and
publicly.
>
Due to the above new criteria, some of the candidates were not selected.
Directly speaking, the new criteria were secretly created, which is against
the rule of competition, to kick out those candidates, which is unfair and
even a crime.
>
Another main issue of the PHC is that 9 candidates were chosen without
providing comparison results with proper metrics, which are against all
other competitions such as AES, SHA-3, Caesar Competitons, etc. The
competition should be scientifically based on proper metrics with clear
comparison (not based on voting out of favoritism), according to the
criteria which were given in the beginning.
>
Since I was one of internal evaluators of SHA-3 candidates as a guest
researcher of NIST for three years, it more seems to me that the procedure
of the PHC looks immature to me. Even the PHC panel's recent selecting
procedure undermines the dignity of the PHC, the PHC panel, submitters, and
even crypto community. Please think it seriously.
>
I hope that the PHC panel might accept and correct their mistake and make
every effort to restore our dignity including everyone participating in the
PHC.
