Thanks for clearing this up. Since most good password hash functions use salts with at least 128 bits, it is easy to
wonder why indexing by salt would be a good idea.


It's not just about indexing by salt, though. You still have to maintain
a list of salts to hash each plaintext candidate with, and remove salts
from said list when a salt is eliminated. Regardless of how you do it,
it is the number of salts, not the number of hashes, that slows down a
cracking job. Unless you are working with very large lists on AMD GPUs,
but that's a whole nother can of worms.
