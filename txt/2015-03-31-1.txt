This is crazy, but are you possibly the same Bill Cox I knew around RTP, NC in the early 1990â€™s?

Subject: [PHC] Unintended consequences are sometimes awesome

This is just me saying thanks again for everything.  Working with geniuses such as Alexander, the Catena guys, Steve Thomas, and Lyra2 guys has been fantastic.  As a result, I've left the place-and-route field where I worked for 25 years, and joined Google to work on better security.  I would not have predicted this a year ago!

So, thanks for everything.  It's been awesome!  The PHC rocks!

Bill
