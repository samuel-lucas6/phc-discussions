Hash: SHA1

I remember thinking the code for Prallela was easy to read.  Here's my
notes from last spring:

- - Parallela is a tiny KISS PBKDF2-style hash
- - Doesn't use HMAC
- - Has parallel and serial time costs
- - Nice little PBKDF2 upgrade

I don't expect to be able to do a lot of the work I can do on memory
hard algorithms.  No TMTO attacks, no benchmarking different memory
sizes, running memory hash data through Dieharder, etc.  So, I'm
looking forward to an easy review :-)  I'll just check the input
hashing of parameters, see if can find any bugs, verify that I can't
bypass the serial computations, verify that it outputs at weakest
settings still pass Dieharder tests, etc.  Sounds fun.

However, if you'd like to dump on Parallela, this is a good time to do it!

Bill
