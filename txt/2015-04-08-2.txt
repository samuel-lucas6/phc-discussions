Thanks!  Yes, blake2b_update() appears to always hit a memcpy() on "in".

Perhaps that's the way to write such functions these days, although there
must be a performance hit from this when running on an architecture such
as x86 that would permit you to access integers in "in" directly.

According to http://blog.regehr.org/archives/959 , memcpy could be 
optimized away.
