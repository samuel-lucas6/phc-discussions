at this point, we have

gambit     | N/A - cost/memory dependent

i can not make sense of it. gambit has independent time and memory
cost, with a limit. but you certainly can run m-fixed and t-fixed
tests. the t-fixed case is easy, m cost is m*8 bytes. the time is
interesting, it will be slightly dependent on m.

example test values:

m=1..1000000  t=200000
m=1000  t=200..200000

ok, I was probably too quick in disabling it and did not return to it.
(It printed a lot of assert messages about supported parameters,
not much user friendly and I did not study it in detail.
But that's really not point here, sorry.)

>- I run variable input/output test to check if it influences run time (see graphs).

the graphs have weird outlying points. is this some artefact of the
measurement technique? i don't think that algorithms behave that
peculiarly. in case of gambit, you have a point at 250, which is way
outside the valid range.

You mean in the input/output length test? That's probably just the color key in legend,
not really measured value :-)
(Do anyone how to disable it in gnuplot? Yes, it is confusing, sorry.)
