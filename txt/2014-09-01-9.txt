Hash: SHA1

PolyPassHash is a very cool idea.  To authenticate any password, you
have to prove you know at least N correct user/password combinations.
 Once you've done this, you can authenticate passwords as they come in.

This falls into the "other" category.  It might be a useful bolt-on
for an authentication server along with a decent password hashing
scheme.  I am really glad the author submitted it so we could all
enjoy reading about the algorithm.

However, I feel it is far enough removed from being a password hashing
scheme that it doesn't belong among the eventual "winners".  If we can
give it an honorable mention, that would be fine :-)

Since this is the place where I list my gripes, I will mention that I
had to do a lot more debugging work to get PolyPassHash working than
the others.  However, it's no big deal.

I think that's all I really have to say about PolyPassHash, other than
to thank the author for the cool paper.  Thanks!

Bill
