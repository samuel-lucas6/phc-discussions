I understand the reasoning behind allowing submissions to
cross-polinate, so to speak, but I think that's outside the scope of a
competition. Perhaps authors interested in doing so could present their
works-in-progress and/or ideas on this list (or elsewhere) from now
until the submission deadline.

Even if the deadline were extended through March and everybody had
their original submissions ready today, I don't think the remaining
time would be sufficient for such cross-pollination to occur. This is
why I think the restructuring is important. However, I'm fine with
postponing that part of the decision until March, like JP suggested.
