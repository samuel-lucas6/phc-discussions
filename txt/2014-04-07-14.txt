The definition of weakly-secure KDF, given in
http://palms.ee.princeton.edu/PALMSopen/yao05design.pdf requires the
adversary to distinguish the output of the KDF from uniformly-random
output of equal length. In the case where the KDF's output is 1000 bits
long with each bit carrying 1/10th bit of entropy, the adversary can,
with high probability, win this game in a single query just by counting
Hamming weight.

In terms of practical rather than mathematical security, "assuming the
*full* output is being used" is unreasonable. If a function is sold to
me as a KDF, I expect to safely be able to destructure its output in
order to derive multiple keys from a single invocation.

I would not recommend to derive multiple keys by splitting up a KDF
output. You should either use a KDF which supports the derivation of
multiple key from a single password (e.g. Catena-KG. :-)) or use
different passwords for each key.
