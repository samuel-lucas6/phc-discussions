Could you elaborate what you mean? Usually, the salt is known to the
attacker, so there is no need to *crack* a salt at all?

I didn't say the salt was cracked, I said the salt was eliminated.
Hopefully you are familiar with how password cracking software works.
Each password candidate has to be re-hashed with each unique salt. This
is where your N-times slowdown comes from. Once a hash has been cracked,
its salt is removed from the salt table and future candidates are not
hashed with that salt. Thus the salt table shrinks with each successful
crack, and the effective speed of the attack increases with each
eliminated salt.
