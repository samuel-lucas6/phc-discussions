What do you mean by GPU portability here?  Simplifying OpenCL
implementations for testing, or for actual defensive use of GPUs?

Simplifying implementations for testing, in order to realize all the
possible advantages of GPU cracking earlier than the attacker does so.

We don't yet exploit this (except possibly to a very limited extent that
an OpenCL compiler and the hardware might), so I wouldn't attribute the
current results to it.  I've been thinking of communicating suggestions
on how to try exploiting this to Agnieszka today.  So we'll likely try.
If successful, this should let us pack more concurrent instances of
Argon2, and should provide much speedup over the results so far (as
we're not yet bumping into memory bandwidth, by far).

What is the parallelism parameter BTW? p=1 for all schemes?

Combined, these result in Titan X being 3072/640*1000/1096 = 4.38 times
faster.  In case memory bandwidth ever becomes the limiting factor (as
we optimize the code more), it's similar too: 336/80 = 4.2 times faster.

I understand, but why do you get 37x advantage of yescrypt from there?
Don't these properties speed up yescrypt as well?
