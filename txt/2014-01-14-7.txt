Looks like 500 MiB DDR3 is currently $4.22 retail. This doesn't
sound cost-prohibitive

please note that the proposed hypothetical machine consists of 2^32
units. if you want to add $4 memory to all of them, we are talking
about 16bn dollars + a new power plant. granted, you work for MS, so
you can imagine that :) but not many others can.

​The paper says it needs ~2^42​ bytes of memory (page 3).  Assuming we use
500MiB units, it means you'd need around 8,400 of them, give or take.  For
$4.22 a piece, that's less than $36,000.

Unless my arithmetic is off (in fairness, my handling of basic arithmetic
is surprisingly poor so definitely worth double-checking).
