I think Alexander is right that using the smallest t_cost is more
meaningful (even though the data may look strange).

There is a general problem in the time-vs-memory comparison:  when we are
testing the candidates with the smallest t_cost, their memory hardening
security are not the same (may differ a lot).

Cool!  Why are these for t_cost from 2 to 5, though?  Where's t_cost 0
and 1?  I think only behavior with the lowest supported t_cost matters
for selection of a scheme, whereas exactly how higher t_cost affects the
behavior is merely additional information to be used for fine-tuning.

Well, it was just test run, but once it is already here:

(I'll run all algs up to 8GiB but it will take long time -later)

  So for small memory allocations it can be even zero (because that process
  already have some memory pre-allocated). My intention was to show that it
  really have expected peak there.
  (So it will not match your calculation exactly but it must be very
close.)
