Minor code fix: use generator g = Finv(1) rather than g = 0.  This way, we
know that all possible values are reachable in the internal "tmp" variable
of the F function, which is F(a) + F(b).  g generates the whole group, and
m*g does not repeat until m == 2^bits.

Again, there's something very off here... something super dumb.  I bet this
is trivially proved insecure.
