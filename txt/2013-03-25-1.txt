Firefox (meaning probably NSS, so potentially lots of other products as well)
did this for quite some time, possibly years.  It was only corrected when I
noticed it with dumpasn1 and filed a bug.  Even then it took them over a year,

Elcomsoft had discovered in 2010 that Blackberry backups used just one round of PBKDF2. I
don't know whether that was a design error or an implementation error.

If Andrey Belenko is following this discussion, he might be the one to ask. (I'm not sure exactly
when he was with Elcomsoft).
