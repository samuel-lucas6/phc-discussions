I found commit c793a7a871ad7ce54d3f780d8e1fbe8d5c2f699e "added keyed
server relief", made by you today.  Can you explain how this differs
from what Christian Forler referred to here? -

"Catena supports "Keyed Password Hashing" [...] I just added the
feature."

Is this Catena_Keyed_Hashing() (available before) vs.
Catena_Keyed_Server() (added now)?

but I'm sure that we are going to update the submission soon.

This is merely an API enhancement, not a tweak, right?

You are totally right. I don't know how I missed this. The most
embarrassing thing is, that this would already be possible with
Catena. The only thing missing is the server-side finalization with
encryption.
I hope I haven't caused any confusion with my previous mail.
