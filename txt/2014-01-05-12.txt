Subject: Re: [PHC] Proposed timeline changes

I suggest to

1) Move the submission deadline from January 31 to March 31 (with unchanged
requirements)

2) Agree on a new tentative timeline before March 31 (which may be further
revised depending on the quantity and quality of submissions)

Any objection?

We may be flexible if that is likely to benefit the project.

However we won't accept submissions after the initial deadline. And round
2 is about shortlisting a few submissions rather than receiving new ones.
The game has to have rules :)

That was _so_ last November. Why do you have to bring up the past? :P

  Personally, I think the deadline is fine as it is: it's been advertised
for a year.

A year is not a very long time. Some people (not me, of course) only found
out about the competition a few months ago. Some people will not find out
about it until Monday. Maybe a year is not long enough. But maybe it is.

I personally would like to see it extended just because I haven't found
any time at all to work on my submission since October, and I'm really
sweating the deadline. Nov - Feb are extremely hectic for me, as I imagine
they are for many of you as well. I am strongly in favor of the revised
timeline.
