I think I've at least glanced at all 24 entries now and it doesn't look
like there are any which are intended to be friendly to defensive GPU
use. I think this is an unfortunate omission.

Parallel it's SIMD, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC friendly. It's not memory-hard,
but as a defender you can use whatever hardware the attacker is using.
Well besides maybe ASICs but it depends on how interface to them is. If
it's a simple send password and salt or initial key and get a hash back
then yes, but if it's a here's the salt and hash now let me send you a
bunch of passwords to test and ask if one of the last N passwords match
then it won't work.
