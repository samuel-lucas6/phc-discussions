Hi JP,

I've just noticed that Gmane thinks that messages on this list are due
to expire in 14 days after posting.  It may be removing them from the
public archive then.  This is caused, I think, by the well-known default
configuration issue of ezmlm, where it sets "X-No-Archive: yes" on all
messages.  I think you'll want to remove this line from the headeradd
file and contact Gmane admins asking them to have their system disregard
this header on already posted messages.

Perhaps you'll also want to adjust your ezmlm defaults, so that the
problem does not reoccur for another list you setup.

Thanks,

Alexander
