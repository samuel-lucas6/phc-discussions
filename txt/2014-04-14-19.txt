one observation. STR_TO_LE_ARRAY and LE_ARRAY_TO_STR assumes little
endian, but in fact the only thing that potentially cares about
endianness is the Trans function. otherwise, we just store and
restore, which is endian neutral.

not sure if it worth noted or something.

Fixed:
# STR_TO_LE_ARRAY *        Converts a string to a WORD_SIZE little endian
integer array
# LE_ARRAY_TO_STR *        Converts a WORD_SIZE little endian integer array to a
string
...
# * These can be endian agnostic unless transform() is used in a way that
endianness
#   matters.
