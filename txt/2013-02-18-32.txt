Subject: Password hashes as URIs

There's been some work on an RFC for hashes-as-URIs:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-farrell-decade-ni-10

I believe this has been discussed earlier, but I think one of the
interesting things this competition could also produce is a similar URI
scheme for storing password hashes: one that includes the algorithm name,
the hash, salt/nonce, and the algorithm-specific parameters.

A scheme like this could allow someone to have several different password
hashing schemes active at once (e.g. if they started with one scheme but
are lazily upgrading to another, newer scheme) and would also allow
interoperability between these libraries.

Yay? Nay?
