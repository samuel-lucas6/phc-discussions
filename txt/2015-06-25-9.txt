Agreed.  Password hashing alone is not enough.  I recommend the use of
extra security layers, such as secret-salt, master keys, large ROMs, and
such.  Even more important is an authentication system that uses all
available signals to detect accounts under attack, and take countermeasures.


For this huge set of users, a successful side channel leak means they are
compromised, regardless of it taking *amortized* 6x more work for the
attacker.

Huh?

They're passwords are only compromised if an attacker already breached the
salt database, yet failed to gain access to the password hash database, and
only if the attacker can associate usernames with the salts and cache
timing data.  This should be rare.

I can tell there are a lot of mathematicians on this list.  A mathematical
definition of "compromised" would mean that an attacker learns exactly
nothing, or the system is "broken".  If an attacker learns that somewhere
in the world, an unknown user logged in at exactly 10:38AM, then the system
is "broken".  User authentication is a sticky wet mess.  Clean mathematical
lines like this are not particularly useful.
