Cool. I'm eager to see the performance benchmarks of your
implementation. Please contact me after you finished the implementation.

It's a little more than 2% faster and uses half the ram.
I also found another bug. Nothing that breaks security just changes the output.

You replace the data r[reverse(i, garlic)] with the new calculated value. When

r[reverse(reverse(i, garlic), garlic)] == r[i]
