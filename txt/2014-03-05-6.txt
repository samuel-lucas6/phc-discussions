Subject: Re: [PHC] escrypt 0.3.1

It looks good to me.  Assuming I recall the N and r parameters
properly (r == 8 means N is in 1KB units, right?), then this is quite
a bit faster than the default scrypt install on Arch Linux, Core
i7-3770:

Scrypt: 0.5 GiB in 1.8 seconds
Escript: 1 GiB in 1.4 seconds

This is single threaded, and includes memory allocation overhead.  I
tried p 1, but it didn't reduce the runtime for some reason.

I think keeping compatibility with scrypt is a great idea for escript.
 Regardless of the PHC, escrypt is a faster and improved scrypt, and
as such should see plenty of use.  If you're interested in something
completely different than scrypt, you're still invited to work on
tigerkdf :-p  It's already mostly your and Christian Forler's ideas
anyway.
