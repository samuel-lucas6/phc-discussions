It might even be doable on a bot-net.  In a bot-net example, each
node would hash against 2GiB.  They would have a queue of maybe
several MiB of partially hashed passwords.  After hashing them all,
they would be sent to the next node over the Internet.  In his
case, the Internet bandwidth dominates, but at 256KiB/s, that's
still 4096 guesses per second, which isn't bad for a bot-net node.

Actually, that would be 4096 password updates per second.  The number
of updates required is set by the t_cost parameter.  The minimum is 1,
in which case this attack is especially ugly since no communication
between botnet nodes is required.  Even with the fix, the minimum
t_cost needs to be high enough to make communication bandwidth between
nodes a heavy limiting factor.  The arena size could be decreased to
help compensate for increasing the minimum t_cost.
