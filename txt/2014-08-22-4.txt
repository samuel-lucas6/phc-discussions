Suppose you'd optimally attack Catena-3 at 1/32 memory, and Lyra2 and
Argon at full memory.  However, if Catena-3 at same defensive memory
cost setting is e.g. twice faster than Lyra2 and Argon (an arbitrary
number for the sake of illustrating my point), then this may enable a
defender to use roughly twice more memory with Catena-3 to achieve the
same (maximum affordable) time cost per hash computed.  Once Catena-3 is
tuned like that, its non-tradeoff area-time cost probably grows by a
factor of 4, meaning that it loses to Lyra2 and Argon only by a factor
of 8, not 32 as this could have originally appeared.

I was wrong in "only by a factor of 8, not 32".  For a moment I confused
1/32 being the optimal tradeoff point as the attack being 32 times
cheaper, but it's not as bad as that.
