Subject: Chip size

Just remembered this photo [attached] I took at Defcon last summer. The EFF was auctioning off donated items as a fundraiser.

If you look closely, you can see that this wafer is not an array of smaller chips. It is *one big circuit*, possibly some kind of CCD imager for a telescope or imaging satellite.

Of course, such a large circuit is likely to result in a low yield, which perhaps explains how they ended up in the kitsch supply chain. But it is an existence proof that wafer-sized circuits are possible, modulo thermal solutions.
