Some further issues:

Lines 86 and 87 are buffer overflows if inlen + saltlen 2048. Line 114
is a buffer overflow if outlen 2048. There are no checks for these
conditions.

When t_cost = m_cost = 0 and outlen = 2048, the only irreversible
operation performed is discarding the final value of 'carry' in the
stir() function. This makes Schvrch vulnerable to a straightforward 2^64
preimage attack when these settings are used.
