`hash.call(salt, link)` is constant time. salt has constant size, link has
constant size so the input has constant size.
So it doesn't matter if I count compressions or invocations here.
This doesn't hash the whole chain on each iteration. link != chain

I think we call that "rainbow tables"!
Rainbow tables are somewhat similar, but not the same thing.
