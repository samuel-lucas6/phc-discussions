Yeah, that would get you into trouble.  I've never heard of anything happening
to someone who simply patented someone else's work, or re-patented someone
else's patent, unless one of the parties felt aggrieved enough to go to court
over it (and spend a fortune in legal fees and years of time over it).

Since it was done for a company (TapLink), and it looks like their business
model revolves around the patent, I doubt very much whether they have any
interest in doing this.
