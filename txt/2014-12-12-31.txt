at the point when you called "start attacking before knowing the hash"
nonsense. i know it was a misstep, because you referred to the
solution earlier (lookup tables).

I see. To be clear, I didn't say it was nonsense, I said it made no
sense. As in, the way it was worded made no sense to me. That's why I
asked for clarification, which was met with insult. Now that you have
clarified his intention, I understand what he was trying to say. But to
me it still seems like a very awkward way to phrase it. Anyway, yes, I
agree that this was a misstep.
