I added the missing keyed finalization to Catena. You can now use
server relief, keyed hashing and client-independent updates together.
You can find it on github for now, but I'm sure that we are going to
update the submission soon.

You are totally right. I don't know how I missed this. The most
embarrassing thing is, that this would already be possible with
Catena. The only thing missing is the server-side finalization with
encryption.
I hope I haven't caused any confusion with my previous mail.
