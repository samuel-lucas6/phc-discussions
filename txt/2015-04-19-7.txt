Yes, but referring to entire blocks of the memory-hard algorithm.

The best differential probabilities I could find are over 3.5 rounds
of Blake2b or 4.5 rounds of just the compression function[1]. [2]
limits a rotational distinguisher to 7 rounds. This hints that Blake2b
reaches a high diffusion after just a few rounds. From my
understanding, this would make this attack unfeasible.

Catena's reduced Blake2b tries to be as close to the actual Blake2b as
possible. The diffusion should be similar to the original. At least I
can't find anything that would affect it.

Doesn't Catena use blocks much larger than a single BLAKE2b output?

I haven't looked at Rig or Lyra2 in depth, but both of them seem to
omit the message schedule and the state. It's beyond my capabilities
to judge if this influences the diffusion significantly.

You're looking at the wrong layer.
