6,458,020 unique SHA1s were leaked from LinkedIn. So let's assume you are
right on 50% cracked in one minute. If it was properly salted the best case
is it will take 3,229,010 minutes (6,458,020 * 50%) or about six years.
Granted crackers would be smarter on their guesses so it would be less than
six years to crack 50%.

So an attacker who was after the most number of passwords would try the most

Not salted: N_50 sha1 / Hps = 10 ms to crack 50% of passwords

Salted: N_50*6458020 = 65.8e9 sha1 / Hps = 6.58 s to crack 50% of passwords

So salting means the single-GPU attacker requires 6.58 s instead of 10 ms.

Am I wrong in my estimate of N_50? I got the impression from previous breaches
that it was typically more like 10,000. What am I missing?

Actually we're both wrong. There are 175 million users at the time of the break
in. There are 5,787,239 unique hashes that were released (once you remove the
first 8 characters of the hash because some hashes had their first 8 characters
zeroed out).

N_50 = 100,000
speed = 1 billion/s

unsalted: 0.1 ms (100,000 / 10^9)
salted: between 4 hrs 52 min and 2 hrs 26 min (175,000,000 * 100,000 / 10^9 to
175,000,000 / 2 * 100,000 / 10^9)
