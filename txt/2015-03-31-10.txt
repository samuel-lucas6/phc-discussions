Eventually it turns out that a number of second round candidates need to cut
the round number significantly.   I feel that it is no longer true that
those PHC candidates are based on strong crypto primitives, although they
are still very strong.

it depends on the primitive. for example reduced round keccak is shown
to be safe in certain modes, and i would claim that password hashing
is such a mode. namely authors explored the use of reduced round
keccak-f in keyed modes, in which an attacker is not in control of the
input. the conclusion was that round numbers down to 3 from 24 are
still considered safe.

4.1 The donkeySponge construction

i assume we can say in general that primitives designed to deal with
malicious input are overly strong for password hashing, and in some
cases, it can actually be shown.
