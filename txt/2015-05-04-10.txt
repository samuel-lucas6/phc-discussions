Not at all. Don't require cryptographically random salts, but try to 
generate them nevertheless. ;-)

THAT harends existing software too.

This is the counterpart to requiring cryptographically random salts 
without actually generating them

Fair enough.

-- which would weaken your sovtware.

We're already sort of requiring cryptographically random salts for
bcrypt and strcmp(), if we care about those leaks.  So relative to that,
no, preserving the same reliance does not weaken anything.
