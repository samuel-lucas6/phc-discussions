Subject: TigerPHS renamed to TwoCats

Naming mania!  Sorry about that.  Since Tiger was already taken, and
since my cat Noel was upset about my picking Tiger over her, I've
renamed NoelKDF/TigerPHS to TwoCats instead.

The paper is in good shape given the lack of skill of the author.  It's at:

    http://waywardgeek.net/TwoCats.pdf

The code is at:

    https://github.com/waywardgeek/twocats

If there were another month or so, I'd continue
hacking/testing/upgrading, but there's not.  This is probably very
close to what I will submit.

Bill
