Subject: Argon2 modulo division

Dmitry, all -

It appears that Argon2 uses modulo division with arbitrary (and
changing) divisors (usually not powers of 2).  Argon2d applies this to
secret-dependent integers.  This is an extra source of timing leaks, on
top of secret-dependent lookup addresses.

Do we consider this a drawback?

TwoCats had this too, but I avoided this maybe-drawback in yescrypt.
