Hm, there seems to be some indeterminism in Argon2 itself here? According
to spec: "The actual number of blocks is $m'$, which is $m$ rounded down to
the nearest multiple of $4p$."


 To ease the hashing process, Argon2 allocates the same amount of memory
for each thread. Therefore, when you request 9 or 10 KB of memory and 2
threads, 8 KBytes will be used in fact. The output values will be
different, of course, as the requested 'm' is hashed as well.
