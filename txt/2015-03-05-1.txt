Having had to implement, test, and maintain a new gratuitously incompatible
password PRF for every single security protocol I've implemented that uses
them (PGP, SMIME, SSH, SSL, and CMP) I'd really like the number of knobs kept
to a minimum, perhaps one for CPU use and one for memory use and that's all.
The less bells and whistles, the better.
