I'm not familiar with everyone on the panel, but I think it would be
useful to have someone with an understanding of having to deal with a large
number of legitimate authentication sessions.  Someone who, say, manages
Gmail logins (IMAP, web, etc) may have insight into what sorts of cost
parameters they would like to have.


I'm on the panel, and work for LivingSocial. We certainly aren't "Google
Scale" but we handle millions of logins a day for tens of millions of users.
