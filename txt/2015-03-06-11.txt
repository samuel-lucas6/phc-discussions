I like this proposal -- it strikes a balance between taking public feedback and getting something done. 

If you object please suggest an alternative.

Iterate. Put something out, ask for comments. Decide on the comments.

It would be foolish to not capture detailed public requirements; the panel may be brilliant but will not think of everything, you just want to make sure you have a process which can converge. Maybe not everyone will be happen in the end, but if something is omitted it shouldn't be because no one knew about the requirement.

selecting but before announcing winners)?
