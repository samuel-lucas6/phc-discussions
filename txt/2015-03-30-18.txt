Dear Jakob,

I see. The output of POMELO is designed to be random.

You may mark POMELO as KDF.   Thanks.

Best Regards,

Yes, I'll plan to look into this soon.

It is not there because I did not find any mention that POMELO can
be used directly as a KDF in the paper (and the use case is for
KDF). The garbage-collector attack paper
http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881 also mentions that it is not KDF
in Table 4.

Hi,

we did not mark POMELO as a KDF for the following reasons:

The authors of POMELO (v2)
1) ...did not claim that POMELO can be used as a KDF
2) ...neither claimed nor proved randomness of the outputs which is
   required for a good KDF
