Also loading a large ROM into memory might not be good for UX in certain
cases. This is OK in cases where the ROM is always in memory like
authentication servers, but for FDE it might be annoying waiting for it to
read a few gigs from disk. Although this isn't a big problem for new SSDs,
my craptop would take awhile.

Don't use EARWORM for FDE. As discussed in the submission document, it's
designed for authentication servers and nothing else.

Oops I guess I should read those papers. I spend all my time looking at the
code because comments and documentation can lie, code can not. Fun I say
that because I was just caught looking at a comment that "lied" :).
