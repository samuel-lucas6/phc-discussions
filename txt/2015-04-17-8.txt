I found this:

     https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=311000.0

The scheme seems similar to Makwa, but simpler.  Here's the math from that
link:

public params:

n=pq (primes p & q deleted at setup)
g=shared generator
e=2^(2^w)-1 ie a big, big number w is work factor
    (Bill: why subtract 1?)
y=g^e mod n (generated cheaply at setup, or computable one-off cost
afterwards)

blind:

m=message
b=random blinding factor
r=g^b*m (broacast r to miners)
    (Bill: this is mod n, right?  Also, that's (g^b)*m, not g^(b*m))

work:

s=r^e mod n (expensive because e is big and carm(n)=(p-1)(q-1)/2 is unknown)

unblind:

u=y^b (unblinding factor)
    (Bill: again mod n, right?)
m^e = s/u (as s/y^b=r^e/g^{be}=g^{be}*m^e/g^{be})
    (Bill: by /u, I assume we find g-inverse, and compute y differently)


This is simpler than Makwa, but I haven't put any thought into attacking
it.  Thomas Porin, what do you think of this again?

Bill
