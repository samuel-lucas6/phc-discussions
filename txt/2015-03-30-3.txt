This is just me saying thanks again for everything.  Working with geniuses such as Alexander, the Catena guys, Steve Thomas, and Lyra2 guys has been fantastic.  As a result, I've left the place-and-route field where I worked for 25 years, and joined Google to work on better security.  I would not have predicted this a year ago!

So, thanks for everything.  It's been awesome!  The PHC rocks!
