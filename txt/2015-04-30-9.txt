Subject: Re: Multi-thread charts

The two most important charts are the 6-thread case, because my CPU has 6
cores.  While it's fun to show what's possible by including TwoCats, the
"winner" in both charts is actually Yescrypt, since it's still in the
running.  At high memory, it is a virtual tie with Argon2d.  However, at
low memory, Argon2d does not do as well, but Lyra2 begins to catch up to
Yescrypt.  This exemplifies Yescrypt's best quality: it just works,
regardless of your use case.
