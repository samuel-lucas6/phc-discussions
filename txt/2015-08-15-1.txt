Subject: Crypto puzzle

I've attached a 56 line Python program, which I wrote after having three
beers at the live music fest here in Tam Valley.  It is either:

a) Shear stupidity (typical of my dumb ideas)
b) Earth shaking new public key crypto
c) yawn

Most likely, it's both not new and wrong at the same time :)

Hint: Just about any random permutation F(x) can be used to create an
abelian group, using the addition law: Finv(F(x) + F(y)).  I know...
post-quantum right?

I really should not post late after the Friday night party...

Bill
