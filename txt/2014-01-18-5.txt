we'll be lucky to convince folk to use anything more than a
salted-hash let alone something that will hog all their processor
cores and memory for each login attempt (whether that attempt is valid

Agree completely. We can be memory hard without saturating the memory
bus. bcrypt is a good (but imperfect) example of how we can be memory
hard while using very little RAM.
