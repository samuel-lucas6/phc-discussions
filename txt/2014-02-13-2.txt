Hi Thomas,

PasswordsCon will indeed be the de facto place-to-be, however we don't plan
a formal presentation of each candidate by its designers: unlike AES/SHA3,
where most submissions came from well-funded academics, it's unlikely that
most PHC submitters can travel and talk about their submission at a
dedicated conference.

There may also be a presentation about PHC at DEFCON, as a way to elicit
feedback and contributions.

When the candidates are all submitted and published (in less than two
months now), where will they be discussed ? The AES and SHA-3 competitions
had dedicated conferences, where the candidates were discussed at length.
Am I right to assume that Passwords (as in "http://passwordscon.org/")
will play this role ? I.e. that this will be the "place to be" for PHC ?

On a similar vein, will there be a dedicated time somewhere for
submitters to "make their case" (e.g. 15 minutes for each submitter to
explain with slides how marvellous their creation is) ?
