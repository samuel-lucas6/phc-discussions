two observations.

1. no, at this stage, we don't need input checking at all. this is
not a library, but a reference. that is, documentation of the
algorithm.

2, even in a library, i suggest using only assert-s, if at all.
such a low level subprogram does not have any better means of
communicating an error condition that should not happen in the
first place. it is the responsibility of the caller to use correct
parameters.


While I disagree,  input range checking is only a minor tweak.  I
think you would agree that this must be done before the PHC publishes
reference code for the statement  I am doing a *lot* of attacking PHC
candidates right now, I personally would appreciate input checking, so
I don't waste time showing that an entry is weak against invalid
inputs.  I appreciated POMELO's statement that t_cost + m_cost  should
be >= 8 for reasonable security.  That kept me from launching attacks
with lower values, where I think I could do some damage.
