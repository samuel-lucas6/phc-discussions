A naive question based on my limited knowledge of cool terms like abelian
groups - if you did this using elliptic curves could you not worry about
the security of pq? And just suffer the once off work to calculate y. Or
does the math not carry over to elliptic curves?

The math does not carry over to elliptic curves (or, at least, I did not
find a way to), unless you do something like generating a curve of order
n where n = pq with p and q unknown (in which case you gained nothing).

Generally speaking, algorithms that have an EC equivalent are algorithms
that work with multiplications only, modulo a big prime (like DSA or
ElGamal).
