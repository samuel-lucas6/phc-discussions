I also recommend Form C, since that's the form most text is in if you
apply no normalization. That way you maximize interoperability with
implementations that don't bother with normalization. UTF-8 and no BOM
are obvious choices as well.

generality. For instance, the switched-case equivalent of "sTRASSE" can
be either "Straße" and "Strasse"

I think in this case we want the caps-lock switched equivalent, which
is a question mark `?` for `ß` on the German keyboard layout.
