Subject: Password hashing categories for the wiki?

I wonder if it would be useful to describe the various categories that the
PHC is interested in on the wiki.  The functional categories I think I see,
based on the entries, are:

1) Bcrypt style cache-bound hashing with unpredictable addressing, and good
GPU defense
2) Catena style cache-bound hashing with solid timing attack resistance
3) Scrypt style large memory algorithms with strategies for reducing
cache-miss penalties
4) Password hashing schemes for authentication servers
5) Other (and this is a very cool category!)

Some entries focus on one category, such as EARWORM and authentication
servers, or Catena and cache-bound timing attack resistance.  Others span
multiple categories, such as Yescrypt.  Makwa and PolyPassHash are very
cool "other" entries.

Would it be useful to break out the different functional categories on the
wiki, and list entries competing in those categories?
