Hi Bill,

I'm a total newbie and am curious how/why "this" is of greater concern than
the password itself being swapped to disk?  Is it that only heap space ever
gets swapped whereas stack/local memory never does?

My current strategy for filling memory (subject to change) is the addition
of a "seed" parameter to PHC().  Kind of like a "pepper" except that it
wouldn't necessary need to be secret.  As you point out, an attacker need
only generate the fill pattern once.  However, if the amount of memory we
fill is sufficiently large, and well fill it quickly enough, the attacker
will still suffer some overhead to keep a second pristine copy on hand.
(I'm assuming memory will be modified as part of the "waking" process.)

Thanks,
Gary

P.S.  Although my scheme is not yet implemented, my seed parameter will be
combined with the salt and/or password in some way, to seed the PRNG that
ultimately fills memory.  This way at least an attacker will have to redo
the calculation for each password.
