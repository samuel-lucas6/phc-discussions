I'm trying my best to write pseudocode for submissions

i don't know how to proceed. i'm willing to help with gambit, but i
feel that by the time i understand your coding standard, you would be
ready with it yourself.

another question is whether you use the PSH interface, or the
underlying real interface? the former might be a subset of the actual
proposal, it surely is with gambit.

anyway, if you could use some assistance, let me know.
