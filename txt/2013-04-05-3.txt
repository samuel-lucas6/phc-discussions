A good starting point is to treat it as a PRNG:  A hash function
whould have the exact same mathematical properties as a PRNG, with
the single addition that the same input always produces the same
output.


I would rather say that a hash function could be used to built a PRNG
(basically either hashing its previous output value or hashing the
output from a validated (P)RNG) then this PRNG could be evaluated.

A PRNG has only its seed as input and produces an infinite amount of
output values, while the hash function has one input value and one
output value.

A hash function has other properties to be evaluated regarding its
output (avalanche effect, etc.)

So using the PRNG test is probably a first evaluation step, but doesn't
seems to be enough.

IANACNAM (I am not a Cryptographer nor a Mathematician)

So what others tools, methods are going to be used to evaluate password
hash functions ?

Regards.
