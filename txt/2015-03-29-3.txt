Subject: Unintended consequences are sometimes awesome

This is just me saying thanks again for everything.  Working with geniuses
such as Alexander, the Catena guys, Steve Thomas, and Lyra2 guys has been
fantastic.  As a result, I've left the place-and-route field where I worked
for 25 years, and joined Google to work on better security.  I would not
have predicted this a year ago!

So, thanks for everything.  It's been awesome!  The PHC rocks!

Bill
