In the case of PHS(), it is defined as returning a status code (an
"int"), so it has a way to report an error condition after all.

yeah, i forgot about that interface. if the definition contains a
result code, and there is no other source explaining it in detail, one
should assume that no exceptions or other error conditions can happen,
and all situations must either give back a correct result or report
the error via the result code.

personally, i thought nobody will ever call the PHS. i thought it is
just a documentation on what to actually call.

    memcost = (m_cost + 1) * statelen;

i would argue that this is a minor bug. one should not derive input
ranges from such lines, they should come from a documentation, or must
be assumed to be equal to the range of the type. i'll definitely check
my submission again if it complies.
