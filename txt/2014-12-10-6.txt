The original criteria were much clearer than your paraphrase. I'm
not sure why you paraphrased the criteria as such. It makes the
discussion that much more confusing.

i did not paraphrase, it was a char by char copy, with the examples
and details in parentheses cut. which important detail was missing?


What are these new aspects? I'm confused what you're confused about. 

- quality of the documentation
- quality of the reference implementation
- originality and innovation

none of these are in the original list.
