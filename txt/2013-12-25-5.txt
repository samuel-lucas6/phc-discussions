Sorry for this poorly informed post... I was unable to find a good

one that simply spits out random numbers for a stream cipher that I
can easily benchmark?

Probably the best resource, as pointed out by Tony, is eBACS:
http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-stream.html. The times are measured in
cycles per byte, so lower is better.

hydra7 (Intel Sandy Bridge) seems to have AES-NI implementations, which
are still slower than Chacha8:

MARC speeds up ARC4 by almost 2X, making it speed competitive with
Blake2.  Blake2 is based on ChaCha, which in turn is based on Salsa20.
 From what I've read so far, ChaCha claimed to be faster than Slasa20,
and Blake claimed to be based on ChaCha.  Why would Salsa20 be faster
than Blake2?
BLAKE2 is a hash function. It has different security requirements, which
end up requiring more computation (i.e., it's slower) than a dedicated
stream cipher like Salsa20. How are you even using it as a PRNG? It can
be used to make one, but that's not the first option I'd consider.
