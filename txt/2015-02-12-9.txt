But it does mean nothing less than some seasoned cryptographer at NIST looks
at a reported attacks and thinks "oh, this feels bad" or "nice work, but I
don't think this will go much further". Anticipating the likelihood that a
reported weakness gets worse cannot be based on hard scientific facts.
Nevertheless, this is an important part of the decision process.

these are the kind of statements i actually demand. because these can
be considered, evaluated, debated, refuted, etc. the PHC panel so far
failed to publish any documents that could possibly spark any
meaningful debate or criticism. we don't have anything.

lately, we at least had some progress, but still a long way to go.
