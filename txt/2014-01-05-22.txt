Daniel Franke (at Sunday, January 5, 2014, 5:47:36 PM):

are already finished, and its spec nearly so, but the security and
efficiency discussion is not yet written.

however, those are not requirements. obviously, since we already have
candidates with security proof, any candidate without it are at a
disadvantage. but still, it is possible to enter, and maybe, if the
algorithm seems to be promising, it will advance to the next round.
however, without reference implementation, if we take the requirements
strictly, a candidate must be disqualified.

also, i claim that for the selection process, security properties are
important, but test vectors are not really. they are important for the
standardization process, which comes much later.
